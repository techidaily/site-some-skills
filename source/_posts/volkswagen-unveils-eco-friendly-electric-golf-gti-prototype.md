## Volkswagen Unveils Eco-Friendly Electric Golf GTI Prototype

There are not a lot of cars that are as iconic as the reliable Volkswagen Golf in its many variants. The tiny compact car has a presence all over the world, and its relatively affordable price gets you a comfortable, reliable, and compact vehicle that will not disappoint you. Now, as part of Volkswagen's [push towards electric vehicles](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/pro-level-performance-a-compre-cookie-box/), the German car maker has just showed off yet another concept on an electric Golf — this time, with the ID GTI moniker.

 Volkswagen has showed off a new concept car at IAA Mobility, which it calls the ID GTI. It doesn't carry the Volkswagen Golf name, but rather the new "ID" branding many recent Volkswagen electric cars have used. The car has a close resemblance to the Volkswagen Golf, and the GTI name has also been historically associated to the Golf. The car has a remarkably similar silhouette to current models of the VW Golf, with minor differences such as a redesigned grille and headlights, a redesigned back, as well as back doors that don't have a visible handle. Other than this, this looks like just a reimagining of your average, run-of-the-mill Golf.

 Some of you might remember the e-Golf. This is by no means the first time Volkswagen thinks about an electric Golf, but with this one, Volkswagen is looking to bring it into the vision it has for its ID models. As far as the interior goes, there's a yoke steering wheel and a digital cockpit and infotainment system. There's not much else to go on with the images provided, but it certainly looks like an interesting car — though not one that will be competing with mainstream EVs.

 It's also important to keep in mind that is a concept car, not a production vehicle. This car doesn't have a release date or a year attached to it, so you should definitely not expect to buy it — at least not like this. Volkswagen could very well release a model similar, or even very similar, to this one in a few years, although it will most probably not look 100% like this one.
