## Part 3\. 5 Tips to Come Up With A Unique Name for Your Podcast

If you want to make a podcast name by yourself instead of generating it from a tool, it is essential to know what makes a "good" podcast name. What factors should you take into consideration? And what are some of the common mistakes made by podcasters when it comes to naming their shows? So let's dive into it.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 1\. Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show

The main legal principles with podcasts are copyright, publicity rights, and trademark. Therefore, Avoiding using any trademarked, copyrighted, or already used by another company or podcast is crucial.

Searching Google for trademarks is the best way to discover whether your name idea has already been trademarked. Moreover, you can check for conflicts by applying for podcast name approval via the Apple Podcasts Connect portal. If you're unsure what you want, research similar names before settling.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 2\. Make sure the name has not been used before on Apple Podcasts and Spotify

It is easy to search for your show's potential name in a podcast directory. However, if the same name is already used, it is time to create a variation or start over.

You cannot submit your podcast to Spotify if there is a show with the same title. Doing your research will save you time and hassle.

### Tip 3\. iTunes / Apple Podcasts & Keywords "Spam."

Another goal in boosting or promoting your channel would be to make a channel name that is simple and easy to pronounce. Avoid overly long podcast names or "keyword stuffing," as iTunes/Apple Podcasts are clamping down on this.

When the audience comes and visits your channel, the name of it matters the most as it's the most obvious thing that meets the eyes. In this case, you must create a channel name that is true to your content and catchy so it hooks the audience from the start.

### Tip 4\. Try to say your podcast's name out loud and a lot

As a podcast is an audio medium, your name should be easy to pronounce. You should also be able to recognize your podcast name if you hear it in passing, and it should be easy to pronounce. You can practice saying your podcast name by completing the following sentences:

* "Hi, I'm the host of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."
* "Welcome to another episode of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."
* "You've got to listen to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_!"

Choose a name you like to say because you'll be saying it. A lot.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 5\. Get feedback from your network

Generating a name for a podcast is not an easy job. However, you can also get feedback from your network. For example, you are gathering suggestions from your friends or teammates. If your podcast has already got some followers, you can ask the audience for advice and let them comment below the podcast.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Can 2 podcasts have the same name?

The simple answer would be **"No."** You cannot have a podcast whose name is similar to another. It becomes an issue of legality and ethicality. If you create a channel with a name similar to another podcast, the original podcast channel will have a right to sue your channel.

In some rare cases, there have been podcasts with similar names, but usually, one of them will eventually go down. It is all about originality.

### 2\. Should I name my podcast my name?

There's nothing wrong with naming your podcast with your name as long as it is unique and stands out. You cannot simply name your podcast, i.e., "**Joe Rogan**." Instead, your podcast can include your name creatively, such as, i.e., **"The Joe Rogan Experience."**

### 3\. Can someone steal my podcast name?

If your podcast is in its early stages, you may encounter some accounts pretending to be your channel. Unfortunately, it is common in the industry as people tend to prey on the weak ones. But you can protect your channel by creating a podcast name that is unique in itself.

If you find accounts that pretend to be your channel, you can ask your audience to report such sources. Or the best course is legal action. But first, develop a trademark policy to help you give immunity against these channels.

So if in the future it gets to mislead your audience, they will be held accountable for legal action.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Should I rename my podcast?

You can do that in the early stages of your show's growth. But as your audience grows, changing the channel's name will only disturb your audience. They might think the original content creator was changed or the purpose of the show has been changed.

Keeping to your originality and creativity will set your channel in the light. Your goal should be to choose a Podcast name that is unique from the beginning and work on growing it to its

best potential.
