## Microsoft's Legacy Operating Systems Drop: No More Windows 7 or 8 From Epic Games

In June 2024, the Epic Games Launcher will end support for Windows 7, Windows 8 (or 8.1), and 32-bit Windows 10 installations. You may continue using the Epic Games Launcher with these operating systems, but the lack of software support will eventually lead to broken or degraded functionality.

 Epic Games will still support its launcher on Windows 10 (64-bit), Windows 11, and macOS 10.13+. Ending support for old operating systems is just an easy (and uncontroversial) way to reduce labor and costs. This change may also lead the way to faster, more frequent, or more substantial Epic Games Launcher updates, as the company won't be encumbered by Windows 7 or Windows 8 compatibility.

 In any case, this isn't a great year for Windows 7 or Windows 8 users. Several applications, including the [Steam launcher](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-samsung-galaxy-a34-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), [Plex](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/addressing-hearing-gaps-in-video-content-sharing-for-2024/), [qBittorrent](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-imei-number-of-nokia-g22-through-google-earth-by-drfone-android/), and Microsoft Edge have ended support for the old Windows operating systems. It's an understandable change of pace, as these old operating systems are relatively niche in 2024, especially among gamers. According to Valve, less than 1% of active customers use Windows 7 or Windows 8.

 Old operating systems also present some security concerns. It's been years since the last Windows 7 or Windows 8 update, meaning that both of these platforms contain unfixed vulnerabilities. By connecting these operating systems to the internet, gamers may expose themselves to malware. And if a hacker wants to hijack an Epic Games or Steam account, a Windows 7 user may be the easiest target.

 To reiterate, affected users may continue using the Epic Games Launcher after June 2024\. Epic Games is simply ending software support for old Windows versions. Over time, the lack of support will take its toll, and the Epic Games Launcher will stop working properly on Windows 7, Windows 8, and 32-bit Windows 10 installations. This could take months or yearsâ€”we don't know.

 Some PC gamers are now faced with a difficult choice. Do you stick with a reliable old Windows installation, switch to the [nearly-retired](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-screenflow-unleashed-the-ultimate-macos-experience/) Windows 10, or fall into the cold, [advertisement-filled](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-creating-a-clickable-thumbnail-enhancing-video-visibility-without-costs/), [AI-obsessed](https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-s-best-video-editors-for-high-resolution-proxy-video-editing/) arms of Windows 11? The good news, I guess, is that [Linux gaming](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-10-essential-methods-to-record-virtual-seminars-at-no-expense-for-2024/) has matured a lot.
