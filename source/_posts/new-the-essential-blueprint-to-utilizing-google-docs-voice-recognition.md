## Part 3: Best Alternatives to Google Docs speech to text service

If you are not a Google Docs user, here are suitable alternatives to voice to text google docs.

### 1\. Windows 10 built-in speech to text service

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![in speech to text service](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-google-docs-5.jpg)

Voice typing is available for Windows 10 users as a default feature. As such, you do not need to download anything additional to use the service. In addition, it allows you to transcribe your audio across all the operating system's apps and programs. For example, you can use the service for searching for items on your computer and also use it with MS Office applications. In addition, the service is free and available offline.

Below is how you can access the service on your device.

1. Press the **Windows Logo and H** keys simultaneously to open the dictation toolbar. You will notice a pop-up menu with a microphone section displaying the word Listening next to it.
2. Speak your words, and Windows 10 built-in speech to text service will transcribe your audio.
3. You can end the recording by speaking the words Stop Dictation.

Although initial versions were error-prone, the current version of Windows 10 built-in speech is quite brilliant. This is because the program utilizes a speech recognition software to determine your speech patterns. The program will require you to repeat a phrase thrice before it becomes active.

However, you should still expect errors if your voice is not clear, as with other voice typing programs. In addition, it only supports seven languages compared to Google Docs speech to text's 71.
