### Key Takeaways

 To use Microsoft's new Bing Chat AI:

1. Visit [bing.com](http://bing.com/) with the Microsoft Edge web browser.
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account.
3. Click "Chat" at the top of the page.
4. Choose a conversation style and type your prompt.

 iPhone and Android users can download the Bing app and access the chatbot from there.

 The AI chatbot space is starting to really heat up. Microsoft has its own version of [ChatGPT](https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-how-to-find-free-sites-for-sound-effect-and-add-them-in-final-cut-pro-for-2024/)\---called the "new Bing" or "Bing Chat"---and it might be even better. Let's take a closer look at Microsoft's favorite new toy.

##  What Is Bing AI Chat?

 Bing Chat---also referred to as "New Bing"---is an integration of ChatGPT with Microsoft's search engine. Similar to how Samsung has its own flavor of Android, Bing Chat is essentially Microsoft's flavor of ChatGPT.

 To understand Bing Chat, [you must understand ChatGPT](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-capture-clarity-editing-insights-for-professional-results/). They are AI chatbots built on OpenAI's large language models (LLMs). Essentially, the chatbot is fed an enormous amount of text data for "training." It uses that data to predict what the next word in a sentence should be. The goal is to get it to a point where it can generate human-like responses to prompts.

Related: [What Is ChatGPT, and Why Is It Important?](https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-how-to-find-free-sites-for-sound-effect-and-add-them-in-final-cut-pro-for-2024/) 

 The big difference between Bing Chat and ChatGPT is how Microsoft has customized it. Bing Chat is tuned for search, and it's clear about that when you use it. Bing shows you what it's searching for, and it lists sources for everything. Also, Bing is using OpenAI's latest LLM, [GPT-4](https://program-issues.techidaily.com/mastering-mw3-comprehensive-troubleshooting-for-dev-error-6068/), while ChatGPT has GPT-4 locked behind the paid ["Plus" subscription](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus).

##  How to Chat With Bing AI

 To use Bing AI Chat, you can simply go to [bing.com](https://www.bing.com/) in Microsoft Edge and select the "Chat" tab. Check out our guide if you want to [use Bing Chat in Google Chrome](https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-journey-to-stickers-full-tutorial-for-turning-gifs-in-chat-apps-like-discord-and-telegram/). We'll demonstrate how to use it on the desktop here, but it also works on iPhone and Android (as shown in the section below).

 First, make sure you're signed into your navigate to [bing.com](http://bing.com) in Microsoft Edge and make sure you're signed in with your account. Click the "Chat" shortcut in the top menu.

![Tap the &quot;Chat&quot; shortcut.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-30_12-04-29.png) 

 You're now looking at a page with a text box at the bottom. Before you start chatting, pick one of Bing's three conversation styles:

* **More Creative**: Longer, more descriptive, and "imaginative" answers.
* **More Precise**: Shorter, straightforward search-focused answers.
* **More Balanced**: Informative and friendly, somewhere between the other styles.

![Select a conversation style.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-30_13-44-08.png)

![Enter a prompt and hit enter.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-30_13-45-43.png) 

 Before Bing starts answering, you can see what's happening in the background.

![Bing working in the background.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-30_13-46-07.png) 

 Bing "types" the answer in real time. When it's done, the sources are shown at the bottom of the text bubble.

##  How to Use Bing Chat in Windows 11

 Bing Chat is somewhat integrated into the Windows 11 Start Menu and Search feature---it appears when you start doing a search. However, at the time of writing, it's really just a shortcut to the web version of Bing Chat shown in the section above.

 First, open the Start Menu or click the search icon/box in the taskbar.

![Click the Start button or Search button.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-30_14-45-43.png) 

 If you go the search route, you'll see the Bing Chat button immediately on the right side of the menu. From the Start Menu, you'll need to start typing first. Click the button to go to the Bing Chat website.

![Click the Bing Chat buton.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-30_14-46-43.png) 

 Alternatively, you can start your prompt in the Start Menu/search by typing it out, then click the "Chat" button on the left side of the menu. This will take you to the Bing Chat website with the prompt already submitted.

![Enter a prompt and click the &quot;Chat&quot; button.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-30_14-49-58.png)

 Now you're able to use Bing Chat just like you would anywhere else! While it's a little clunky to still be taken to the browser, this is a nice little shortcut for Windows users.

##  How to Access Bing Chat

 Microsoft launched the new Bing Chat feature with a waitlist, but that waitlist has [seemingly been removed](https://win11.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-to-smooth-directx-installation-on-pc/). Since March 16, 2023, most people are now able to sign up and immediately get access. Microsoft did not confirm if it removed the waitlist.

 To get access to Bing Chat, head over to [bing.com/new](https://www.bing.com/new) in the Microsoft Edge browser. Click "Join the Waitlist."

![Click &quot;Join the Waitlist.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-30_15-08-22.png) 

 After signing in and following the steps, you'll get an email that says you're on the waitlist.

![Email after joining waitlist.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-30_15-10-53.png) 

 When you have access to Bing, you'll get another email that says "You're in!"

![Email when you get access to new Bing.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-30_15-11-24.png) 

 Microsoft is opening up the new Bing Chat to more people as time goes on. You probably won't need to wait long---if at all---to start using it.

###  Does Bing use ChatGPT?

 Yes, Bing AI chat has the same backbone as ChatGPT. At the original announcement for the new Bing, Microsoft said the AI chatbot ran on a "next generation" OpenAI (the creator of ChatGPT) large language model. They said it's "more powerful than ChatGPT and customized specifically for search."

 Later, it was revealed that Bing Chat is based on GPT-4, the latest large language model from OpenAI at the time. Meanwhile, ChatGPT was originally built on GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 is held behind the "Plus" subscription.

###  Is Bing better than ChatGPT?

 Bing AI Chat is not better or worse than ChatGPT, but it's clearly a different experience. Bing is based on a newer large language model, GPT-4, and is tuned more for search. Bing shows what it's searching for and provides sources---ChatGPT does not. Bing is also capable of [generating images](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/recover-excel-2013-files-from-virus-infected-pen-drives-for-free-by-stellar-guide/), [creating tables, and fun things like text art](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-facebook-giveaways-a-step-by-step-guide/), whereas ChatGPT is more of a [straightforward text-only](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-unleash-your-potential-with-outstanding-android-time-lapse-videos/) experience ([though plug-ins change that](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-begin-your-editing-journey-adopting-movie-maker-for-w11/)).

###  What is Bing AI chatbot's chat limit?

 Microsoft launched Bing Chat without limits, but it has since capped it to 20 prompts per conversation and 200 conversations per day. This came after people were confusing the chatbot with super lengthy conversations.

###  How long is the Bing Chat waitlist?

 At the time of writing in late March 2023, there [doesn't appear to be a waitlist to try the new Bing Chat](https://win11.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-to-smooth-directx-installation-on-pc/). Microsoft has not confirmed the waitlist has been removed, simply stating the company may "accelerate access to the new Bing for some users" during the preview period.

 That's the low-down on Bing Chat, New Bing, Bing AI, Bing Chatbot, or whatever you want to call it. Microsoft is leveraging OpenAI's work on large language models to infuse Bing with many impressive features. It's already [one of the best ChatGPT competitors](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-must-know-methods-to-record-on-your-ipad/)\---if not better---and Microsoft is in a good position for the competitive AI market.
