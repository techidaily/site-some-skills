#### Read Kobo, Sony, Google Play ebooks on PC with Adobe Digital Editions

Usually your ebooks from many popular stores like Kobo, Sony, Google Play, Smashwords, etc are protected by Adobe DRM. You can't read them in any other reader app except Adobe Digital Editions. 

**Step 1:** **Install ADE and authorize it** 

Install [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions/download.html) in your PC and then authorize it if it's the first time you used it. Click "Help"->"Authorize Computer" to authorize your Adobe ID.

I will take Kobo books for example. 

After you purchased ebooks from Kobo store and added them to your Kobo library, you will see all the items your bought in the library.
