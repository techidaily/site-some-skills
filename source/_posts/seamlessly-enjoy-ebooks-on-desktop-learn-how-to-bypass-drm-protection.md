For Kindle, Nook, Sony, Kobo, Google Play books, etc, you can install compatible ebook reader app on your PC in order to read them, such as installing Kindle for PC, Adobe Digital Editions, Nook for PC, etc. But for your iBooks, you don't have compatible reading app, thus you have to remove DRM from your iBooks.

#### Read Kobo, Sony, Google Play ebooks on PC with Adobe Digital Editions

Usually your ebooks from many popular stores like Kobo, Sony, Google Play, Smashwords, etc are protected by Adobe DRM. You can't read them in any other reader app except Adobe Digital Editions.

I will take Kobo books for example. 

After you purchased ebooks from Kobo store and added them to your Kobo library, you will see all the items your bought in the library.

### Read ebooks on PC by removing DRM from ebooks

You can freely read the above-mentioned ebooks on PC freely with compatible ebook reader app, however, for iBooks, there is no compatible reader app for PC. The only way is to remove DRM from iBooks. 

#### Read iBooks on PC by removing iBooks DRM

Before removing DRM from iBooks, you need to find your books in PC first and check whether they're DRMed or not.

Run iTunes, right click the ebook, choose "Show in Windows Explorer". Then the folder which contains the ebook will pop-up automatically. Or you can directly go to "X:\\My Documents\\My Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Books".

For how to check whether your book is drmed or not, apply [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) to help you. Simply load your book in Calibre and try to open it with Calibre.

If the following message pops up, then the book is DRM protected. If not, your book is DRM free and you can start to enjoy your book on PC with Calibre.
