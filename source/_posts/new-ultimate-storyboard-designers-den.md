### 4\. [Screenwriting.io.](https://screenwriting.io/)

![screenwriting.io](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-4.jpg)

John August, the author of Go, Charlie's Angels, and Big Fish has created one of the best online screenwriting websites for answering basic questions about the craft and business of writing.

Enter any question into the search bar and, nine times out of ten, you'll find an answer.

## Part 2\. Best 5 free websites to download scripts

When I want to see how a more seasoned or, let's be honest, a better writer than me attacks a story, I usually want to read their script. I want to know how they follow the story on the page and for that... I need to see the script.

But since I don't work in a studio, I must find them online and the search can be exhausting. So, what are the best websites for downloading movies and TV scripts?

Let's go through them together.

### 1\. [IMSDB– Internet Movie Screenplay Database](https://imsdb.com/)

This is the first place I go for scripted stuff. They have an extensive catalog and have proven to be a valuable resource for researching film crews, actors, and trivia. IMSDB is equally useful for those looking for screenplays of all kinds and genres, which they have listed in categories.

### 2\. [Go Into the Story](https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/)

![go into the story](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-6.jpg)

I'm a huge fan of Scott Myers. He gives everything to the writer. Go Into the Story is the official blog for The **_Black List,_** the screenwriting community known for its annual list of the top ten unproduced screenplays in Hollywood. There is always a bank of scripts that you can filter.

### 3\. [Simply Scripts](https://www.simplyscripts.com/)

### 5\. [The Screenplay Database](https://imsdb.com/)

![the screenplay database](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-9.jpg)

From the website, Blacklist is "...a closed network that connects script buyers, agents and screenwriters in one place". You can upload your script for a fee and then have users and readers rate it on a scale of 1-10\. It is a way to enter the digital age.

The Blacklist appropriated the term from the McCarthy era of the 1950s and has since become a place where industry figures vote on their favorite projects of the year.

It has since expanded to an online database where users can submit their scripts for coverage and be ranked among competitors.
