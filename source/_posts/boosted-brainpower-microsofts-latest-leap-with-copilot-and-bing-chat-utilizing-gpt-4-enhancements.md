## Boosted Brainpower: Microsoft's Latest Leap with Copilot & Bing Chat Utilizing GPT-4 Enhancements

Microsoft Copilot is the AI assistant now available in [Windows 11](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/mastering-aspect-ratio-rules-for-twitter-content/), Microsoft Edge, [Bing](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/streamlining-your-video-production-with-kinemaster-and-leading-alternatives-for-2024/), and [even Windows 10](https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-definitive-guide-to-captivating-podcast-covers/). Microsoft has now announced a few new features coming to Copilot in the weeks and months ahead, including the new [GPT-4 Turbo language model](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-going-against-the-tide-of-tradition-innovative-techniques-for-yt-rewinds/).

 A new blog post published by Microsoft outlines everything AI-related that was rolled out in 2023, and briefly mentions some changes that are now in testing. First, Microsoft is testing the ability to generate responses using the latest GPT-4 Turbo model, which OpenAI released back in November. The updated model is trained on newer data, (supposedly) more reliable with tasks that require careful following of instructions, and support for larger context windows. Right now, GPT-4 Turbo is only available through a [ChatGPT Plus subscription](https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-effective-methods-to-fake-gps-location-on-android-for-your-vivo-y78t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/) or the company's developer APIs, so this will be the first time GPT-4 Turbo is widely available for free.

 Microsoft said, "Soon, Copilot will be able to generate responses using OpenAI’s latest model, GPT-4 Turbo, enabling you to tackle more complex and longer tasks. This model is currently being tested with select users and will be widely integrated into Copilot in the coming weeks."

 Microsoft also said Copilot now has "an updated DALL-E 3 model," which is available now from the [Bing Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create) or by asking Copilot to create an image. It's not clear if this is just Microsoft talking about the DALL-E 3 upgrade that [started rolling out in October](https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/advanced-speed-adjustment-techniques-in-media-editing-for-2024/), or if it's a slightly improved version recently released by OpenAI. Either way, Copilot can make better images now.

 There's also an improved image search function coming soon, which combines the image recognition capabilities of GPT-4 (which are [already available in Copilot](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-learn-to-screen-capture-flawlessly-on-mac-using-just-keys/)) with Bing image search. Microsoft's example included attaching an image of a space rocket launching with the promot "When was this launched?", which returned information about the rocket launch and the mission.

 Microsoft is testing GPT-4 Turbo now with "select users," and it will be widely rolled out "in the coming weeks." The rest of the changes, including inline compose in web pages with Microsoft Edge and improvements to intrpeting code, just have a release date of "soon."
