![ Gopro flat curved mounts ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-flat-curved-mounts.jpg)

These are basic GoPro Mounts, which can be easily mounted to any curved or flat surface so that your action camera is properly mounted at that spot.

The mounts can be easily detached by applying a heat gun or a hairdryer.

 **Features:**

* The flat and curved adhesive mounts can be attached to any flat or curved surface
* The industrial-strength, waterproof adhesives not just ensures secured mounting but can also be removed by application of heat from a hairdryer or heat gun

#### **2. GoPro Front Facing Mounts**

![GoPro Front Facing Mounts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-front-facing-mount.jpg)

* The camera would extend in front of your helmet for self-recording.
* The polycarbonate body makes it extremely durable.
* It is compatible with all GoPro cameras.

#### **4. GoPro Vented Helmet Strap Mount**

![GoPro Vented Helmet Strap Mount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vented-helmet-strap.jpg)
