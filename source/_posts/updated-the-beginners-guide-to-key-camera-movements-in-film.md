## Part 1: 7 Types of Shots in film You Should Know

### 1\. Establishing Shot

As the name hints itself, this type of camera shot basically establishes the scene the audience sees as the [first shot of your movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishing%5Fshot).

In other words, the establishing shot provides the viewers a maximum of the city or the whole building scene in one frame.

This doesn’t help your audience guess what location is the scene is being shot but they can estimate the time when the scene is taking place.

With this type of [shot in the film](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you are typically showing and not telling the audience through narrative and it is completely enough to let the audience know the concept.

### 2\. Extreme Long Shot

This type of camera shot is taken from a long distance. This brings the audience an idea where the character belongs to regarding the time and the place.

You will also allow the audience to know the emotional relationship to the environment where there is no need to show the character.

![Extreme Long Shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/extreme-long-shot.jpg)

### 3\. Long Shot

Long shot or often known as the wide shot uses characters in the shot. Each character is shown head to toe in relation to the surroundings, location or each other.

Also, the chief character or say the protagonist should have a major presence in the frame.

Moreover, while using this type of camera shot, you must take care that it should be dominated by the scenery.

### 4\. Full Shot

Here, the location can be ignored from keeping in the focus.

The main focus should be on the character in such type of shot in the film. Also, the shot should highlight the action or the movement of the character from head to toe and not his/her [emotional condition](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/07/21/743408637/how-microexpressions-can-make-moods-contagious).

For instance, the audience must get the idea whether your character is confident, weird or sophisticated with just his/her appearance, outfit and the action.

### 5\. Medium Shot

Medium shot basically stands between the full and the close-up shot.

### 6\. Close-Up shot

The name brings a crystal clear image of the type of shot itself. With this shot, one brings out the character’s face thereby helping the audience to understand the emotional thoughts of the character.

This shot basically provides what you miss in the [medium shot](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Bringing the character’s shot more detailing, for instance tear or the frowning so that the audience can anticipate what the character is feeling in that particular shot.

![Close-Up shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/close-up-shot.jpg)

### 7\. Extreme Close Up

To make the audience visualize only some features of the character, the Extreme Close-up comes in handy.

### 13\. Cut-In

This shot typically cuts the screen into two or three or sometimes four parts.

### 14\. Master Shot

Also, this type of shot can be considered as the only shot to be used by a director for covering the scene. It can be a closer shot, full or long shot.

### 15\. Point of View Shot
