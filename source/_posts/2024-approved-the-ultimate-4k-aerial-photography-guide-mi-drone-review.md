Like most of the advanced drone units, Xiaomi Mi also features autonomous flying mode. All that you need to do is simply hit the TapFly button and it will start moving. Users can control all movements with a tap of a finger and you can check all movements with the help of the map.

The most amazing feature of Xiaomi Mi is its ability to communicate via mobile phone so that users can manage the recording focus of its camera. One more appreciable feature is its surrounded flight ability; you can make it circle around any specific object by sending commands from a smartphone. You will love to capture videos with its 360-degree motion ability that leads to incredible clicks. How can we forget to talk about the most advanced feature of this special drone unit that is Preset Rout following ability! Users can make pre adjustments for all flights and it will capture smooth shots every time. The automatic landing and takeoff feature helps in easy controls whereas if this drone goes far from 3meter range then it will switch back to its preset path. It is possible to bring this drone back with only one button and in order to improve its performance, you can access the calibration settings. Note that, if somehow your drone gets lost then it will take almost 30 to 45 minutes for coming back.
