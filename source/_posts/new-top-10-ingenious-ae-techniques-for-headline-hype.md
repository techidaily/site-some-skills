There are certain properties and parameters associated with text effects and animations in After Effects. You need to get a complete overview of these types so that you can adjust them and come up with stunning text animations in After Effects.

### 1\. 3D Text

Generally, when you type a text in After Effects, by default, it comes out to be two-dimensional. All the associated properties have X and Y axis only. However, if you are planning to create 3D text and title, you need to have Z axis.

After Effects has “Enable per-character 3D” property to all Z axis to applicable properties so that you can get the desired effect. You can go to properties like rotation or position to find Z axis that you can modify and get the perfect 3D text.

### 2\. Rotation and Anchor Point

Rotation is one of the most commonly used parameters in text animations. There are unlimited variations of text animations and effects that you can create using rotation parameter in After Effects. The rotation takes place in proportion to the anchor points of the text. When you change the value of Rotation parameter, the actual rotation takes place around the anchor points.

### 3\. Scale and Position

If you want to zoom in and zoom out animation for your text or title, you can use the Scale property in After Effects. You can use keyframes and for each keyframe, you can adjust the scale value and create an illustration of zooming in and out very easily.
