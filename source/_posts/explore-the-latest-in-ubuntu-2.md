##  1\. Accessibility Options

[Ubuntu 24.04 LTS](https://techidaily.com/useful-ways-that-can-help-to-effectively-recover-deleted-files-from-oppo-find-n3-flip-by-fonelab-android-recover-data/) is equipped with new and easily "accessible" Accessibility options. For individuals like myself with less-than-perfect vision, these enhanced settings are a welcome improvement.

 To enable Accessibility options in Ubuntu 24.04, begin by pressing the "Super" key on your keyboard. Next, type "Settings" and open the Settings application. From there, select "Accessibility" from the sidebar.

 The updated Accessibility menu allows you to adjust settings for various needs, including Seeing, Hearing, Typing, Pointing and Clicking, and Zoom. I often opt for "Large Text" due to my minor vision issues.

 Overall, the enhanced Accessibility options menu in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is a significant advancement. Consider activating some of these features to enhance your experience with the new Ubuntu release.

##  2\. The Quick Settings Dropdown Menu

 One of my favorite features in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is the quick settings dropdown, located at the top right of the desktop. To access the dropdown, simply click on the Power button.

 Once you click it, the quick settings menu will appear. This menu allows you to quickly toggle settings such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Ubuntu 24.04 also offers the option to switch between power modes, which is useful for conserving energy on your laptop.

 In Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, I frequently find myself using these settings to easily adjust device functionalities. It's incredibly convenient and a fantastic enhancement to the Ubuntu desktop experience.

##  3\. Window Tiling for Enhanced Multitasking

 Ubuntu 24.04 LTS introduces some excellent multitasking features that are worth exploring. For example, it now includes a feature similar to Windows that suggests app windows when you tile a window in any direction. To access this, open Ubuntu Settings and navigate to "Ubuntu Desktop."

 Under Ubuntu Desktop, look for "Enhanced Tiling." This feature might already be enabled, but if it isn’t, you can easily activate it using the slider. This will enhance your window tiling experience on your Ubuntu desktop.

 But that's not all—there are several other advanced multitasking features in this new release of Ubuntu. Go to the "Multitasking" section, and you'll find many options. For instance, you can enable the "Hot Corner," which allows you to hover over the top-left section of the Ubuntu Desktop to view all open windows.

##  4\. The All-New Firmware Updater App

 Firmware Updater is a new addition to Ubuntu, and it's a tool that everyone should use periodically to manage their devices. To access the app, simply search for "Firmware Updater" in the application menu.

 Once you open the app, it will scan your hardware for compatible devices. If you have any, you'll be able to update them quickly. For example, on my HP laptop, I was able to easily update several devices.

 The main limitation of Firmware Updater is that not all computer manufacturers support the tool. However, if your computer is compatible, it's worth turning on the app to check and update your hardware.

##  Maximize Your Ubuntu Experience With These Settings

 You've seen a glimpse of what Ubuntu 24.04 LTS has to offer, from better accessibility options to quicker system management tools, and improved multitasking.

 Each of these new features not only improves Ubuntu's functionality but also has the power to enhance your desktop experience. Take the time to explore these features further to better suit Ubuntu to your needs.
