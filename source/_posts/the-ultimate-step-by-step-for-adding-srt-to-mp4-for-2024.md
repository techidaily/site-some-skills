## Part 2: How do I add subtitles to a video without any software?

Although using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software is the best way to add SRT to MP4, you can also get the job done without downloading any software.

Step3 Once you've successfully uploaded the MP4 video file, you'll be given options that you want to use to add SRT to MP4\.
