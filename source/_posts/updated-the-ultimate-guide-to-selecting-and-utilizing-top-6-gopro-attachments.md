![ Gopro flat curved mounts ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-flat-curved-mounts.jpg)

These are basic GoPro Mounts, which can be easily mounted to any curved or flat surface so that your action camera is properly mounted at that spot.

The mounts can be easily detached by applying a heat gun or a hairdryer.

* The flat and curved adhesive mounts can be attached to any flat or curved surface

![GoPro Front Facing Mounts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-front-facing-mount.jpg)

The front-facing mount attaches to the flat part of the helmet to give you self portrait and front-facing angles. Just attach the base of your mount onto any part of your helmet and give it 24 hours to adhere.

 **Features:**

* The helmet front mount would let you set your action camera in a low profile position on the front of the helmet.
* The camera would extend in front of your helmet for self-recording.
* The polycarbonate body makes it extremely durable.
* It is compatible with all GoPro cameras.

![GoPro Vented Helmet Strap Mount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vented-helmet-strap.jpg)

 **Features:**

* Attachable to all vented helmets
* The adjustable straps would allow you to mount in no time.
* The size fits all helmets.

#### **5. GoPro Side Mount**

![ GoPro Side Mount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/side-mount.jpg)

This mount that can be attached to the side of your helmet is a smart option for motorists who don’t wear full-face helmets. While the helmet front mount gives you a centered angle, the side mount would give slightly off-center angles. This official mount is attachable to all GoPro models.

## Optional Mounts

#### Chest Mount Harness

![ Chest Mount Harness ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-chest-mount.jpg)

Though the helmet mounts are the most popular mounting option for your GoPro camera, you have many other options for mounting your GoPro.

The chest harness can be adjusted to fit almost all adult sizes and are compatible with all models of GoPro.
