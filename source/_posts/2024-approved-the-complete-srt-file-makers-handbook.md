To create a .srt file for your video on a Windows computer is pretty simple. Yes, you don't require technical knowledge or any third-party software for such an operation. All it takes is just a few clicks.

That being said, keep in mind that before you start creating SRT subtitles for your video, you must have reviewed your video and have a copy of the audio/dialogue that you want to use as a caption in the SRT file. This will prevent you from making errors during the SRT creation process.

Step1 Start your Windows computer and open the Notepad program. Then create a new file.

* Type 1 > under it, write the first Timestamp. The timestamp should be written in hours:minutes: seconds, milliseconds format as shown below;

_1_

* _00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:11,834_

The times displayed indicate the beginning and end of when the subtitle appears on the viewer’s screen. Ensure to make this time as accurate as possible.

Step3 Move to the next line and type your subtitle content - the text that will show on the screen. This should be one or two sentences. Long texts should be broken into multiple subtitles to make them easy for viewers to understand.

Step4 Repeat steps 2&3 for the remaining subtitle contents.
