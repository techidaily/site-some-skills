## What is Royalty-Free Music?

**Royalty-free music**

Is music that can be used without having to pay royalties. This music requires a one off payment or, as in the case of Epidemic Sound a recurring subscription fee.

However, royalty-free music is not cost free. The term just means that users don’t have to pay a royalty each time they use the music. Royalty-Free music simply helps users avoid the pitfalls that can result from trying to navigate complex licensing requirements.

## Selecting the right Background Music for your video

This is always my struggle personally but if you know how to find fit music for your video your enjoying every moment while editing because finding or selecting background music that suits to may video creations is a must to create a quality content.

When it comes to selecting songs for background music, think if it like you’re enhancing your own content by reinforcing some emotion or feeling. There are so many things to consider when it comes to what makes good background music. What’s the tone of your content, and who is the audience?

Consider if you are a Product reviewer or explainer use subtle music to maintain the attention of your viewer to the information and product demo. If you are action Vlogger or doing daily lifestyle Vlog, use clear music to explain and advance the plot.

Remember choose music that speaks to your audience, the more you know about your audience’s age, affiliations, and preferences, the more specific you can be about your music choice. If your viewers cover wide swath of professionals in business, it’s best to play it safe with corporate tones. Classic rock, and ambient music. But if you know that they’re younger hip hop and dance music might be more appropriate.
