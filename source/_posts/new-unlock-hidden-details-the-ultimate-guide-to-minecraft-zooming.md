Most gamers are aware that in order to construct your ideal Minecraft environment, you must gather several materials and employ them. While doing this, you must safeguard your base from intruders and gather all the fresh materials necessary to design and populate your planet as you see fit. You may perform zoom in Minecraft windows 10 by using the following instructions to zoom in. But if this option is there in the version you're using, it will often be found in the "Options" or "Settings" menu, tucked away in the "Video" sub-menu (or the platform equivalent).

## Way 1\. Change FOV in Options

Although the PC version of Minecraft doesn't come with a built-in zoom in or out feature, you may change the field of view to suit your tastes. A higher field of view setting will allow you to see more in a single frame, but everything will look a little bit smaller. A zoomed-in display is possible by lowering the field of vision and limiting the number of objects you can see.

Step1 To access the in-game menu, launch a game and hit the Esc key on your keyboard.

However, moving the FOV slider all the way to the left also means that you won't be able to see as much during gameplay.
