## Organize and Revamp Your MP3 Collection with Mp3tag Version 3.27

Need to organize a bunch of audio files? Mp3tag v3.27 is now available with enhanced File List searching functionality and other improvements.

 Mp3tag is arguably the best freeware audio metadata editor. It's easy to use, it can pull metadata from sources like Discogs or MusicBrainz, and it supports advanced functionality for automatic tagging or track identification.

 The new [v3.27 update](https://community.mp3tag.de/t/mp3tag-v3-27-released/65520) introduces [Ctrl+F searching](https://docs.mp3tag.de/find/) in the File List. Users could already set up filters for the File List, but Ctrl+F searching provides a more granular view of files that fit a text-based search criteria. The new search function also takes place in a dedicated window, and it offers several refinements that narrow your search—you can find files that end with a specific string of text, for example.

 Mp3tag v3.27 also introduces a new Cover Dimensions column for Discogs metadata searches. This should help users avoid oddly-sized cover art, which is surprisingly common on Discogs, particularly for special-edition CDs and other items that were originally sold in non-standard (IE: not perfectly square) packaging. Other improvements include AV1 video-detection support in MP4, error reporting for busted MP4 files, new support for Opus in MP4 containers, and new MP4-specific field mappings.

Mp3tag

 Interestingly, Mp3tag v3.27 does not utilize the official tak\_deco\_lib.dll library (which was only available as an external DLL). It now relies on a custom TAK parser developed by Florian, the author of Mp3tag. This change was made after bad actors distributed Mp3tag with false versions of the TAK library DLL ([CVE-2024-7193](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7193)). Additional changes and bugfixes are listed in the [changelog](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/changelog.html).

 Note that Mp3tag v3.27 is only available on Windows. The [macOS version of Mp3tag](https://mp3tag.app/) is a separate app with a unique release schedule. However, you can run the Windows version on Mac or Linux with Wine-based tools, like [CrossOver](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ut-costs-on-downloads-with-this-list-of-20-free-youtube-sound-rippers-for-2024/) or [Bottles](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/2024-approved-moments-replay-module/).

 You can [install Mp3tag v3.27](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/download.html) today for free. Mp3tag does not support automatic updates, so you'll need to update it manually. That said, the Microsoft Store version of Mp3tag _does_ support automatic updates, but it may take a few days to push v3.27.
