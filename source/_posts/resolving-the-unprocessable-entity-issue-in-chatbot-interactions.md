 Have you run into an “Unprocessable entity” error on ChatGPT? If so, your prompt may have an unsupported special character in it, causing the site to display an error. You can fix that as well as a few other items to resolve your issue, and we’ll show you how to do that.

##  Reload Your ChatGPT Web Page

 When you first encounter an “Unprocessable entity” error, a basic fix to apply is to [refresh your ChatGPT web page](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-turning-images-into-scenes-syncing-beats/). Your current web page may have a minor glitch, which you can fix by reloading the page.

 To do that, click the refresh icon beside your web browser’s address bar. Alternatively, use the Ctrl+R or, on a Mac, Command+R shortcut.

![Select the refresh icon beside the address bar.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1-refresh-chatgpt-site.png) 

 On a mobile browser, press and pull down on the webpage to refresh. When the web page has reloaded, continue with your prompt, and your issue should likely be resolved.

##  Remove Special Characters From Your Prompt

 If you have special characters in your ChatGPT prompt, that may be why you’re seeing the above error. Your prompt may have characters that ChatGPT doesn’t support, leading to an error. In this case, remove special characters like brackets (angle <>, curly {}, square \[\]), back and forward slashes, and quotation marks from your prompt. Keep your prompt as special character-free as possible.

 Note that ChatGPT doesn't have an official list of unsupported characters, so you'll have to use some trial-and-error to identify special symbols that cause problems.

##  Avoid Sending Too Many Queries

 If you’ve sent too many prompts in a short period of time, that may be why an “Unprocessable entity” error has occurred. [ChatGPT may have had trouble](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/play-hevc-h-265-on-galaxy-xcover-7-is-it-possible-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-hevc-video-on-android/) recognizing your queries.

 You can fix that by waiting for some time before sending your next query to ChatGPT. This gap between queries gives ChatGPT enough time to understand your queries.

##  Avoid Asking ChatGPT Inappropriate Questions

 If you’ve asked ChatGPT a question that’s potentially illegal or inappropriate, you may want to avoid asking such questions to resolve an “Unprocessable entity” error. This is because the site can’t answer such questions, which can lead to an error message.

 While OpenAI doesn't have an official list of questions you can't ask, it's safe to assume inappropriate questions include asking how to do an illegal activity, how to harm someone, how to use software with malicious intent, and so on.

 We have guides on [how you can make the most of ChatGPT](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-achieve-higher-interactions-mastering-the-art-of-square-videos-for-2024/), so use those as baselines for what to ask this AI chatbot.

##  Contact ChatGPT

 If your prompt has no special characters, and you haven’t [asked the tool too many questions](https://techtrends.techidaily.com/boost-engagement-how-to-include-a-pinterest-widget-on-facebook-page/) in a brief period of time, contact ChatGPT and seek a solution to your problem. Your issue may have to do with ChatGPT’s inner workings, which the company’s support team can help you with.

 ChatGPT makes it easy to reach its support team. You can contact the company by selecting the question mark icon on the ChatGPT site and following the on-screen instructions to send your message to the company.
