Why do you want/need to split the books into smaller parts? With larger segments, especially the full book, you can always see how much more is left. And if you use the sleep timer, you know you set it for say 20 minutes and you can easily go back up to that amount to restart. 

 Can you actually split them into chapters? And if so, why does it matter? Maybe I read differently. I read/listen until I fall asleep or have to do something else. I never care where I am in a chapter.

 I really hate the books that are split into several minutes. They are so difficult to manage. If you are streaming them then go into a dead-zone, such as the 20 minute one I have on my hike, many times I can't listen to my book during that time period.

This very much depends on apps that you are using. iTunes prefer one big file m4b which is basically MP4 container with AAC encoded audio and chapters metadata. However there are other apps for which its better to have chapters separated into individual files. And these apps can cache several files ahead or whole audiobook.

I find that I need to split the file because the car cd player doesn't have many options. The choice is to continue or start from the beginning - no way to jump forward to remaining audio after cd has been ejected. Chapters would allow continuing where I left off.

If you are not afraid of command line and FOSS you can try this zderadicka.eu/splitting-large-audio-books/   
 you can automatically convert whole library. Opus is great format for audiobooks with 48 kbps bitrate in same quality as 128 kbps mp3 (eg. 1/3 of space/bandwidth).

I'm not sure what's wrong with your "other players" but I guess maybe you can try to edit the "settings", maybe it will help you. Or you can also visit the official website support center for help about that player.

 Tks.

Just use MKVtoolnixGUI (freeware).  
 It can demux & split the chapters (without re-encoding) to mka files, which you could optionally rename to aac, as that is what they are.
