## Part 2: What is The Minimum Speed For Periscope Live Streaming

 According to Periscope Media LLC., the minimum upload speed required to broadcast/stream your own video is 2MBPS. But, if you want to have a better experience, you will need more. A research and test results reveal that Periscope requires 10.4 MB for viewing a 2 minutes video on an average that is equal to **5.2MB** per minute. So, for faster live streaming, the data requirement on Periscope remains the same.

## Part 3: How To Get A Faster And Better Live Streaming Quality

 Here, I am sharing few tips in order to fine-tune your expertise in video creation on Periscope and take your video live streaming to the next level. To reach the heights in broadcasting, the following streaming habits are essential to follow. With the increase in online video streaming and people getting more and more hooked on the live videos, try to follow the points below for a faster live streaming experience for your audiences.

## Part 4: Delete Cache Files On Your Phone

 The internet files and cache data covers a big space on your mobile phone. It weighs down your device making it heavy for any other videos to open. While closing a browser or a tab, the OS deletes thousands of small sized files that are automatically downloaded in order to open the web pages. When you do not close the browsers properly and shut down your device, the files stored automatically weighs down the browser, effecting faster live streaming and loading speed. Thus, prior to doing live streaming, open the browser settings and delete the recently used history and other provisional Internet files in order to increase live streaming speed.

## Part 5: Connect WIFI When It Is Available

 For any heavy file download or live streaming, mobile data usage can ruin your experience and it is also too much consuming, whether data or time. However, with WIFI, the live streaming becomes easy and seamless. Generally, if you check the speed, the WiFi is much faster than normal mobile data speed. So, it is always recommended to connect the wifi whenever and wherever available.

## Part 6: Use Third-Party App

 If you want a faster live streaming on Periscope, the third-party apps like Speedify can be of great help to increase live streaming speed and improve live stream quality. Poor internet speed can completely destroy your Periscope experience. A reliable and fast mobile connectivity has become crucial for live streaming on Periscope. With the new feature of broadcasting completely handsfree, Periscope requires an adequate bandwidth for live streaming. So, the third-party apps are the best ways to ensure a seamless connection on your mobile and faster live streaming.
