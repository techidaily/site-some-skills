If you have a computer, you will want to have the best media player. A media player can help you manage your audio and video files in numerous ways. Undoubtedly, VLC Mac is many people’s go-to choice for a media player. But before you hop on the bandwagon, review the FAQs about using VLC on Mac.

## 1. Can I download VLC on my Mac?

VLC is one of the media players that operate smoothly on macOS systems too. The cross-platform multimedia player runs on most versions of MacOS systems.

## 2. Is VLC media player free on Mac?

Lucky for all its users, the VLC media player is free to be downloaded, installed, and run on Mac. With this free media player, your wallet will not lose its weight and you will be able to play all file formats on it.

## 3. What is the best VLC version to download on Mac?

All MacOS system users need to pay attention here. Many people complain that the version of VLC that they downloaded off the internet is not functioning properly on their Mac. There is a reason behind its bleak performance.

The latest version of VLC media player is supported on the Mac OS X version. If you have this version then make sure to download the latest release. If not, do not despair because there is something for you too.

VLC offers something for everyone; if you have an older version of the macOS system, you will need previous releases of the VLC media player. But which one?

TIPS

● VLC 2.2.8 works the best on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.

● VLC 2.0.10 is the best VLC media player for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.

● The version VLC 0.9.10 has proven to be the best fit for Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.

● For Mac OS X 10.3 Panther, the VLC 0.8.6i should be used.

● If you have Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, only go for VLC 0.8.4a.

● Last but not least, users of Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah and 10.1 Puma should install VLC 0.7.0.

## 4. Is the VLC media player safe for Mac?

Generally, the VLC media player is considered to be safe for Mac. In fact, many believe it to be the best media player for Mac. First off, you should remember that VLC is not available on the App Store for Mac.
