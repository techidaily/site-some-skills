One of such major functions of After Effects is it provides different fonts and text effects to its users. Here's a guide on **how to add fonts to After Effects**:

## Part 1\. How to add fonts to After Effects?

Adding fonts to any video editor is a crucial part because texts add a story to the video projects. They have a great impact on the cinematic quality of any video. For informative videos, the style of font decides the tone in which the texts are displayed.

Thus, selecting a proper font for the video becomes necessary in the post-production process. In the After Effects application, there are different fonts available for the users to load and use in any video. And if you are wondering **how to add font in After effects** to your video, then you can follow these steps:
