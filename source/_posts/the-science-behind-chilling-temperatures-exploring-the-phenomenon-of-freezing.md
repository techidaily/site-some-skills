[Epubor Ultimate 3.0.5.4 freezes when Kindle DRM detected](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 5/18/2016 2:15:42 PM 

Hello, it seems that everytime i want to convert a kindle book to pdf, if Kindle DMR is detected, the software freeze and i have to use Windows Task manager to force to kill it. I have other kindle books where DRM is not detected and conversion is flawless. What is the problem?

I am testing the Free Trial version.

 epubor detects the books on my Kindle accurately. Program is set to convert to epub

 I drag and drop a book, msg comes up saying to wait while DRM is removed 0%. Popup stays there, no progress.

 Tried it on multiple books, gave it a lot of time.

 Nothing can be done in epubor when this occurs. Only way to exit it is to kill it from Task Manager. Running Windows 10

[Kindle Books Not DRM'd Program freezes at 0%](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/16/2024 4:06:39 PM 

When I drag my Kindle books to the right the program sits at 0%.  
 It says - The program is removing the D.R.M.encryption. Please wait for this to finish.

 It then sits at 0% and the only way of exiting the program is to end task in Task Manager.
