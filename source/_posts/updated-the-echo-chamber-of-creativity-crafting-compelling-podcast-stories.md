Also, we have listed some pro tips and added some ready-to-go templates to help you get started. So, stay connected till last.

## What Is a Podcast Script, and Why Do We Need One?

A podcast script is simply a plan for the podcast that outlines the main topics in a sequence. Based on your feasibility and the type of show, it can be detailed or include the essential things. However, the majority of podcast scripts adhere to the following basic format.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![podcast script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-write-podcast-script-1.jpg)

### Intro

The intro is supposed to build the audience's interest as soon as they start listening to the podcast. So here, you will warmly welcome your listeners, say some icebreaker sentences, give your intro, and state teaser lines about the podcast.

\*Pro tip: Don't reveal everything; keep it a little mysterious to hook listeners till the end.

### Guest intro

The guest introduction is crucial because people listen attentively if an expert addresses the topic. So, courteously welcome your guest, and mention his name, profession, achievements, and background (if related to the topic).

### Sponsor message

Every brand has a distinct set of preferences; sometimes, they give you a script that you have to follow word for word, and other times they leave it up to you. In either case, the sponsor messaging should look natural and blend with the layout of your show. Besides, a persuasive sponsor message script will motivate listeners to buy brand products, thereby boosting your number of sponsors—a win-win situation.

### Segue

When there are multiple segments in an episode, transitions make switching from one to the next seamless. For example, it may be a piece of music, a phrase, motion graphics, etc.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Summary

It's challenging to retain everything after listening to a significant amount of information. Hence, to facilitate listeners, summarize the entire episode and revise the key takeaways.

### Outro

It's time to acknowledge the listeners and guests for their precious time. To tie listeners to your show, you can mention references, make announcements, and reveal the topic and air time of the upcoming episode.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Call to action

A straightforward call to action can boost the reach of the podcast. Here is how?

Invite the audience to leave a review, share their thoughts about the topic in the comment section, and show your availability to interact with them and answer their queries.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Why do you need one?

Having said that, let me tell you why writing a podcast script is crucial before you hit the record button. First, having a podcast script will simplify things for you and your guest, as you'll know the next point already; otherwise, you will make a mess.

Averting unnecessary gaps and saving time requires planning the segment order and making a list of the main points to discuss. The script ensures you stay on topic and organized to keep listeners interested. A well-planned podcast also requires less effort in post-production. So if you want a streamlined recording experience, take your time and craft a top-notch podcast script.

## Podcast Script Outline Templates

As promised, it's time to introduce you to the three most common podcast script templates. Pick the one that best suits your needs and take your podcast to the next level.

### Template 1: The Word-For-Word Podcast Script

The first right candidate for the word-for-word script is the one about to land in the podcast world. All that is left to do is carry them out correctly since most things have already been written down. This format should also be used by someone presenting a lot of statistical data, facts, and figures.

* Call to action
* \[Closing theme music\]

Segue (can be a phrase, a piece of music, or a sound effect)

Transition into…

Ideas 3, 4, and 5…:

## How to Write a Podcast Script?

The podcast script templates provided above are flexible, so you can customize them to meet your needs and utilize them to increase your productivity when recording an episode. Thus, take the one and head towards your studio.

Although you may have many ideas for customizing the templates, make sure to focus on the elements listed below as you craft your podcast script.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### (1) Choose Your Podcast Segments

Podcast segments vary widely depending on the podcast format; therefore, choosing your components wisely is crucial. However, to keep your show consistent, you should stick to a few essential ones, such as the introduction, discussion, and outro.

In addition, you can include extra segments, like rapid fire, if you want to spice up the show.

### (2) Tell A Story

"After nourishment, shelter, and companionship, stories are the thing we need most in the world."― Philip Pullman.

We all enjoy stories, but producing one is far harder than listening to one. Consider delivering the dialogues in your podcasts like a story, no matter what kind. Podcasts with a narrative format are popular because listeners' interest grows as the story unfolds. Hence, keeping them curious to find out what happens next.

### (3) Mark-ups your script

A script devoid of notes is merely a piece of paper with text. "Mark-ups" is the practice of adding notes to scripts on specific elements, such as giggles, emphasis, pauses, etc. Being humans, we have emotions; therefore, adding emotions to your script will help your podcast sound like a casual, enjoyable conversation.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### (4) Always Close with A Call To Action

You are coming to the crucial section that will help expand your fan base. The Call To Action (CTA) is typically included in the outro, but you can experiment by placing it after the intro part. Whether it's an offer to join the group or a way to sign up for your newsletter, present it as simply as you can.

## Bonus: Pro Tips to Nail Your Podcast Scripts for Beginners

Starting out the journey in the podcast world may not be a piece of cake for everyone. But don't worry, as we are going to reveal some pro tips to nail your podcast script without much effort.

### How do I write my first podcast?

Writing your first podcast script can be challenging, there's no doubt about it, but if you keep the following ideas in mind while writing, you can produce a good one.

**(1) Avoid saying, 'Subscribe or follow wherever you get your podcasts!**

The audience should be given a straightforward task, which we have stated many times previously. There is a high likelihood that people will ignore you if you ask them to "Subscribe or follow wherever you get your podcasts" or something similar.

Make sure to properly guide and simplify the task for the listeners if you want them to fulfill it. The links to other platforms where your podcast is available can be either attached in the notes section or included in the podcast itself.

**(2) Don't overdo it with CTAs – it's good to have a range, but stick to one or two per episode.**

Sometimes podcasters get overenthusiastic and stuff each episode with CTAs. That's insane... Right? Respecting your audience's time is just as crucial as getting views; failing to do so will result in losing them.

It's good to have a range of CTAs, but stick to one or two per episode and try the rest in future episodes. It's okay to repeat that one or two CTAs a couple of times during the episode to increase the probability that viewers will follow through.

**(3) Mention that it's free to follow or subscribe**

Along with the CTA message, it's a good idea to mention that following or subscribing is free. However, people may think they need to pay to subscribe because everything is shifting to a charged model from a free one.

**(4) Know the animating question of your podcast episode, and focus on answering it**

One of the most effective ways to keep the listeners interested throughout the episode is to communicate answers to their questions about that topic. The animating question is that a specific part of your episode answers an existing question. The key to finding the animating questions is "Research," which will help you focus on the answers listeners want to hear.

## Podcast script Hot FAQs

### 2\. What makes a good podcast script?

## The Bottom Line

The crux of our discussion is that a compelling podcast script makes it simple to put ideas into action when your ultimate objective is to create high-quality content.
