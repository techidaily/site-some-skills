## Get Your Personalized Internet Access with SpaceX’s New Portable Starlink Mini Device

SpaceX's portable Starlink Mini receiver is now available to anyone who wants on-the-go satellite internet. This is the smallest satellite dish in the Starlink catalog, and it's primarily intended for outdoor enthusiasts, frequent travelers, or professionals who work in areas without cell service.

 The Starlink Mini initially launched as an add-on product for existing [Starlink Residential](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-first-steps-in-virtual-conferencing-with-zoom/) customers. Finally, SpaceX has dropped the Starlink Residential requirement, meaning that anyone can buy the Starlink Mini without an existing subscription.

 Designed for portability, Starlink Mini measures just 10.2 inches wide, 11.75 inches tall, and 1.45 inches deep. It's relatively flat, although the integrated kickstand bulges out the back, and it features a built-in Wi-Fi router (other Starlink receivers use an external router).

 SpaceX believes that people will carry the Starlink Mini on camping trips and professional outdoor activities (photography, scientific studies, etc). So, it weighs just 2.56 pounds. That's about the same weight as two 13-inch iPad Pro tablets, and it's more than manageable in a backpack.

 The only thing that's missing is an internal battery—this puppy needs wired power, and with an average power consumption of 25 to 40 watts, a [portable power station](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-pros-guide-to-conquering-photovideo-importers-in-win11/) will be required for extended usage away from an outlet. A small 200-watt solar panel would come in handy, too.

 Alternatively, you can use a Starlink USB-C to Barrel Jack Cable Accessory to run this satellite receiver off a [100-watt power bank](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-tracking-apps-to-track-vivo-x90s-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). But the official USB adapter cable isn't available at the time of writing. And, in any case, the average 100-watt USB power bank would be drained after an hour of running the Starlink Mini.

 Other specs include a snow melt mode (it heats up to melt snow), an Ethernet port, and IP67 durability. You can find more detailed specifications at the [Starlink website](https://www.starlink.com/specifications?spec=5).

[Starlink Mini](https://www.starlink.com/us/roam) costs a cool $599, but that's just the price of the hardware. Satellite internet service comes with a monthly fee. Most customers will opt for the Mini Roam plan, which grants 50GB of stationary and in-motion data for $50 a month. The alternative service tier, called Regional, includes unlimited stationary data for $150 a month plus an additional charge for data used while in motion. Both plans are contract-free and may be paused from month to month.
