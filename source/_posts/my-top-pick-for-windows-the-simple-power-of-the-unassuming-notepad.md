### Key Takeaways

* Notepad is a simple word processor that allows you to take notes and save them as files in just a few seconds.
* Notepad Eliminates the need for sticky notes, plus it's more eco-friendly.
* Notepad is lightweight, fast, and efficient, which is why I prefer it over other word-processing apps.

 Windows has a bunch of built-in apps that add layers of functionality to your computer. One of the oldest and most popular is Notepad, a simple text editor that has remained largely unchanged since 1983\. Perhaps minimalism is the reason why Notepad holds a special place in my heart.

##  Simple, Convenient, and Effective

 I can't stress this enough: The Notepad app is one of the simplest (but still useful) apps that exists. As soon as you open the app, you're greeted with a white empty canvas ready to be typed on. Notepad has always been like this; it only received minor redesigns and small feature updates. For instance, [Windows 11 introduced a new Notepad](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-screen-and-video-capture-on-android/) with dark mode, a better find and replace, and some layout tweaks.

Notepad on Windows 10.

 The [biggest Notepad update](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/only-took-41-years-notepad-135901177.html#:~:text=After%2041%20years%20of%20being,essential%20features%3A%20autocorrect%20and%20spellcheck.) has actually just dropped recently, and all it did was add spellcheck and autocorrect. I'm happy that Notepad has retained its original design and intentâ€”just like a real notepad, you can quickly open the app, take notes, and save it as a TXT file.

 The reason why Notepad is my weapon of choice over [other word-processing apps](https://driver-error.techidaily.com/overcoming-intel-management-engine-hurdles/) like WordPad and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is simplicity. While it supports basic word formatting like font, font style, and size, it doesn't let you use hotkeys like Ctrl+B and Ctrl+I to bold and italicize text. In some ways, that's a good thing.

 The focus is solely on the text, which is precisely what I want when I'm taking notes. It's a lightweight app that opens almost instantly, and I keep it pinned at the top of my Start Menu so that I can open it and start taking notes in less than a second.

 At the same time, Notepad has a few lightweight quality-of-life features that add functionality without sacrificing simplicity. For instance, the "Find" and "Replace" options allow you to quickly find specific keywords. I often use this feature to edit configuration files for video games.

##  No Need for Sticky Notes

 I never understood people who use sticky notes at their desks when they literally have a computer with Notepad on it. Some even put stickies on their monitors! Paper sticky notes clutter your workspace, can't be backed up, cost money, and are [bad for the environment](https://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/environmental-impact-of-paper-production). Plus, my handwriting is so bad that you'd think it was [encrypted](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/the-essential-guide-to-youtube-video-lighting-tips-for-2024/). Traditional notebooks have many of the same drawbacks, plus finding important notes is frustrating because you can't press Ctrl+F to search for keywords.

 Everything else in my life has been digitalized, so why wouldn't I digitalize notes as well? Notes taken with Notepad are eco-friendly, clutter-free, can't be misplaced, and they have search functionality. Notepad is always available, right there on your computer, which means you don't have to waste a second on looking for your sticky notes and pen.

 The way I use Notepad is identical to how I used my notebook in school. I jot down notes in Notepad, and I keep the app minimized in the Taskbar for easy access. If it's just a mini-brainstorming session or some temporary random notes, I won't even save it as a TXT file to spare myself the clutter.

##  It Makes for a Perfect Text Clipboard

 If you need a space to temporarily store text, like with the [clipboard feature on Android](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-the-essentials-of-webcam-capture-with-free2x-app/), Notepad is perfect. I could technically use the built-in [clipboard in Windows](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-gain-twitter-gifs-for-pc-download-made-simple/) for the same purpose, but I always forget it exists, and I think that Notepad is faster. I can just hit Alt+Tab quickly to open Notepad, then Ctrl+A to select the whole text, and Ctrl+C to copy the text. I also have more control because I can precisely select what piece I wish to copy.

 Moreover, when you paste a text into Notepad, any formatting is automatically removed. This means you can copy and paste it into a different word processor without needing to fix the format. This is especially useful if you switch between Word and Google Docs or an HTML-based word processor like WordPress.

 Notepad's simplicity is its greatest merit. It's a fast and reliable little tool. Even if it was a third-party app rather than built into Windows, I'd still use it regularly.
