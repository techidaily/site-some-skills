Pic Editor provides advanced background removal tools that allow a great level of precision, while options such as Target Area or Target Color can be used to speed up the background removal process.

![magic-eraser-remove-photo-background-create-transparent](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magic-eraser-remove-photo-background-create-transparent.jpg)

This photo background remover app allows you to have fun with your photos because it provides powerful tools that even a child can use. The app lets you zoom in to the pixel level, which allows you to have more precision while you are removing the background of the photo. The Magic Wand tool removes the same color areas of a photo automatically, and the app offers a wide range of brushes that goes from very soft to hard. Magic Eraser allows you to save high-resolution images without a watermark in PNG or JPEG file formats.

#### 5\. [Cut Paste Photo, Background](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cut-paste-photo-background/id1192981123?mt=8)

![cut-paste-photo-background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cut-paste-photo-background.jpg)

The photo background remover app lets you erase the background of an image, and it provides over a hundred HD background templates. Users of this iOS app can also add multiple foregrounds to a photo, while 25 blend options guarantee that the final picture is going to look realistic. Stickers, filters, or text options are also available to all users who want to create images for social media.
