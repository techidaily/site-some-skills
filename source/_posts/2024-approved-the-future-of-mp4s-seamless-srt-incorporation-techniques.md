## Part 2: How do I add subtitles to a video without any software?

Although using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software is the best way to add SRT to MP4, you can also get the job done without downloading any software.

With Clideo, you can add subtitles to a video on any device including Mac, Windows, Android, and iPhone. Plus, it supports basic editing features that can always come in handy to make the addition of Subtitles do video just like a walk in the park.
