As the first point, the **macOS Big Sur update** will allow you to switch to a Mac with Apple’s ARM-based chip shortly. Also, you get the ability to run iOS apps on Mac that is the first time in Apple history.

Here are the reasons to find why a Big Sur upgrade worth trying for:

* **Rendered desktop look:** Customizable widgets, notifications management, control center, and redesigned visual complexity to provide more focus on the content.

You can also [click here to get it from the App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-big-sur/id1526878132?mt=12)

**Step 2: Install the update**

After the download, the installer will open automatically, whereby clicking the “Continue” option, follow the onscreen instructions.
