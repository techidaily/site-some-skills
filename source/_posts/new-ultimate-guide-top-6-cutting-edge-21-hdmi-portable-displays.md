Having been promised for a long time, we're finally seeing HDMI 2.1 monitors hit shelves - or will do in the near future. Both console and PC gamers will benefit from these monitors, which give them the ability to play 8K @ 60FPS and 4K @ 120FPS simultaneously.

The HDMI 2.1 market will have a limited number of HDMI monitors arriving in 2024, but we're here to show you the best models out there.

As we look at the major players, we'll compare their prices, performance, and specs concerning overall value.

Now that we have a lot to discuss let's move on to the best HDMI 2.1 monitors for 2024.

## Do You Really Need an HDMI 2.1 Monitor?

To be frank, talking about the monitor itself, few companies and factories are making these monitors at the moment, but a rising trend can be seen without a doubt. So at the start point of this new HDMI tech, we can say that it is still far from the market's mainstream. Prices are high; choices are limited.  

On the other hand, talking about games, say you're buying this for your next-gen gaming console, consider now most games are 4K 60hz or 1080p 120hz. It is still far from what Sony and Microsoft promise.  

But if you're not a price-sensitive consumer or you are a geek, here is our choice of the top 6 HDMI 2.1 monitors you can find in 2024.

## Top 6 Best HDMI 2.1 Monitors
