Colors play an important role in showing the creativity and standards of a brand. For example, you may notice that almost every box in McDonald’s is in red and yellow color.

It includes products, voice charts, targeted audience, and core values.

If you are going to start a decor business, you should use royal colors for unboxing, like pitch black and chocolate brown. Other than this, never produce stuff that cannot follow your brand's theme; for example, a pinkish makeup box shouldn’t have Nike sneakers in it.
