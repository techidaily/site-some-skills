The world of technology is growing so fast that today virtual life appears to be the reality. The two most common words coined under artificial intelligence(AI), augmented reality or virtual realities, are Metaverse and Omniverse. Both the terms roam around the same space but carry some differences also. With Facebook changing its name to Metaverse, this has indicated the future that will live in the space alongside the physical life. Omniverse, however, is the connection of metaverses for industrial operations. Augmented reality and virtual reality, alongside sensors, displays artificial intelligence, digital twins, and now the enabling technologies.

### Metaverse

The Metaverse is an internet idea that combines real and virtual worlds by utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as virtual and augmented reality. There has been much discussion around the potential of the Metaverse to revolutionize how we socialize, work, and learn, with Facebook renaming itself Meta to focus on this area and other significant technology businesses such as Microsoft joining in.

The Metaverse is a shared virtual world or interactive, collaborative, and immersive world. Like the physical universe, the Metaverse can be a connection of worlds. Many online social games and video games have reflected what a metaverse represents. Video conferencing tools that link colleagues together amidst the global pandemic are another indication of what’s to come. And just as virtual places will be persistent, so will the identities of those moving through them, allowing goods and identities to move from one virtual world to another and even into our natural world with argumentative reality or virtual reality.

### Omniverse

Omniverse is a verse that contains everything that exists, besides other things that go out of existence. Omniverse is a platform that connects Metaverse into a shared virtual universe. This platform is among a growing number of industries for projects such as design collaborations and creating digital twins simulations of real-world buildings and factories. And only this is a combination of every single universe, multiverse, Metaverse, and more. It may only include our universe if it’s only one that exists, but it will also have them all if there are more.

## Part 2: Compare Metaverse and Omniverse in a Comprehensive Way

The term Metaverse has permeated every conversation about the future of VR, AR, virtual communities, and 3D graphics. However, a key promise in most virtual world pitches is universal interoperability with other platforms and tools. Omniverse can be a tool to speed up creative work on the PC side. Perhaps it will also be the backbone of the next wave of AR and VR innovative applications.

| Metaverse is equivalent to the universe but in terms of digital reality.                                   | Omniverse, in contrast, is the superset or collection of all the existing universes in terms of digital existence and technology.                       |

| Metaverse might not have its own set of standards from one another                                         | It contains all the existing metaverses that govern under certain criteria.                                                                             |
| In the digital world, the metaverse is at the lowest level, eg: Google Metaverse, Facebook Metaverse, etc. | Whereas, Omniverse is at the highest level, which contains all the metaverses in itself.                                                                |
| Metaverse groups may or may not combine as per the user demand.                                            | Combining all the Metaverses, due to which interoperability is possible, is the ease of sharing, operationality, transfer of technology, and much more. |

Omniverse is a virtual tool that allows different areas to collaborate, such as engineers, corporate, etc., inspired by the sci-fi concept of virtual worlds where the universes are all interconnected. Omniverse is a platform that connects the Metaverse to a shared virtual universe.
