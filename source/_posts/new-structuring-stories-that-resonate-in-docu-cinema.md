## Part 1\. What is a Documentary?

To write a good documentary script, you should first know what a documentary is. A documentary is a genre usually used for non-fiction or reality-based films. Such type of films includes researched based representation of a specific subject like interviews of peoples involved in it, official documents related to it, and many more. Sometimes they tell us facts about a particular topic that only very few of us know. They are also beneficial to raising social issues to the officials and making others aware of them. Now that you know what a documentary is let's move forward to our next step, three popular types of documentary scripts.

### 1\. Literary Style

In this style, your only concerns are with the shooting ability of the text for which you should have camera sense, writing rhetorically (but not too much) with the text language literacy, and dividing the script into different paragraphs according to time space and scene. You don't have to describe the technical requirements of shooting in it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Shot-Oriented

In this one, you have to write a detailed description of the action and the images which will be there in your screenplay without considering the script's literary merits and readability. Also, in this style, each scene is divided into paragraphs, and before starting each section, the writer should have mentioned the scene's location, time, mirror, and number. In simple words, this script style provides more detailed and deep instructions about the film or a documentary screenplay.

### 3\. Shooting Script

The director usually uses this style of scripting. After the director of the film or the documentary, the screenplay reads the literary script. He writes a subordinate storyline, including the picture image and the sound, which he is agreed to represent in his film or documentary screenplay.

## Part 3\. Six basic theoretical knowledge about documentary script

### 1\. Ensure the authenticity of the story

The first and most important step in writing a documentary screenplay is to make sure the material and information you use is accurate. Moreover, if your documentary script is based on a true story, you should first confirm the veracity of the tale before drafting the script. It elevates the level of your script's content quality.

### 2\. Define the key issues

Another thing that makes a documentary script best is that it should define the critical issues of the topic upon which it relies. For example, writing a documentary script on a social problem, you should also define its key points. Also, you can add interviews of the experts, or the people involved in some story. It makes your documentary script more effective and influential for the audience.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Highlight the characteristics of the scene

Highlighting the characteristics of each scene of your script makes it much better and easy for others to understand. For example, if you have any fighting scene in your documentary film, you should have to define each thing that will be there and film it in your screenplay. Also, you can suggest or specify the location of each scene.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Visual Writing

Visual Writing means you should make it clear in your script which will be there in a specific scene. Moreover, it would be best if you also described your character's situation. It is the most necessary thing in a documentary script, so you should never take it side.

### 5\. Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)

Another important thing you should take care of while writing a documentary script is that you should continue it in a rhythm, which means you have to pay good attention to the sequence of the events in your film. In other words, you should arrange your script's scenes effectively and accurately, making them in a rhythm.

### 6\. Fully researched

Thoroughly researched data and information are the most necessary, especially when writing a script for a documentary screenplay. It would be best first to explore a particular topic on which you will write a documentary script and then start writing one. It makes your script the best and helps you write it because you will gain excellent knowledge of it by researching a particular topic. Also, it dramatically improves the quality of your script's content. So you should never leave this step before writing a documentary script.

## Part 4\. Documentary script examples

As you can see in the following example of a documentary script of a screenplay named "Albert Einstein." In the following script example, you can see that we have described the images on the left and the narrations on the right side of the table. Also, the primary sources have been highlighted in it and are in bold text, which will help others to recognize them.

| Some video shorts of Albert Einstein's interviews              | Why does he often forget his name even though he is too intelligent?                                           |
| Pictures of Albert Einstein                                    | The answer to this question is in his quote, "The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination." |

| Some video shorts of Albert Einstein's interviews              | He once said, "I have no special talent."                                                                      |
| Pictures of Albert Einstein and then his brain                 | However, he declined that he is brilliant.                                                                     |
