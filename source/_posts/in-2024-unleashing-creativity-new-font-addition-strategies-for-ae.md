Adding fonts to any video editor is a crucial part because texts add a story to the video projects. They have a great impact on the cinematic quality of any video. For informative videos, the style of font decides the tone in which the texts are displayed.

In the After Effects application, there are different fonts available for the users to load and use in any video. And if you are wondering **how to add font in After effects** to your video, then you can follow these steps:

* For adding the Adobe Fonts to After Effects, you will first need to enable them by signing in to the Creative Cloud application on your desktop. To do that, first, open the Creative Cloud, navigate to Assets, and click on Fonts.
