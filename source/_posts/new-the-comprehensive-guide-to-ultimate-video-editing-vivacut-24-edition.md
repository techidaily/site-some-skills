Moreover, if you want some more professional features, add INS or plugins and effects in it and remove the ads from it, you also have to purchase their premium version.

So now, let's move forward using primary or essential editing tools in your videos. As we discussed earlier, you can use almost all the essential editing tools, whether using a free or a premium version. You can quickly get all these tools at the bottom of your mobile's screen. However, some features that need opening through the Canvas menu will not show. You can use these features in your videos by just clicking on them.

### Filters and AI effects

We will discuss how we can apply filters and AI effects to our videos using VivaCut. To use them in your videos, first of all, you have to click on the specific video on which you want to use them from the timeline. A menu will appear at the bottom of your mobile's screen from which you can click on the filters or AI effects option, whatever you want to use. In the free version, you have only access to the limited filters, and AI effects are not available.
