### Disable YouTube Regional Filtering

How often have you come across the YouTube warning; **The following video is unavailable in your country?** According to the developers, theplatform employs a Regional Filter to offer you a more personalized experience based on your location. However, this can be limiting, especially when you are a fan of global news.

Here is how you can disable YouTube’s Regional Content Filter from your web browser.

1. Enter the YouTube URL in your browser and log in to your account.
2. Next, open the blocked content in a new tab and wait for it to load.
3. Then, change the video URL to?<https://www.youtube.com/v/videocode>to access the blocked content. Please note standard YouTube videos appear with the following URL format: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videocode>.

### YouTube Keyboard Shortcuts (Windows)

If your computer mouse gives up, you can still enjoy your viewing using your keyboard. Here is a list of keyboard shortcuts you can use:

1. Press the **SPACEBAR**to play or pause the video.
2. Use the **RIGHT**and **LEFT** arrows to forward or rewind the video. In addition, you can use the **HOME** key to scroll to the beginning and **END** to skip to the end sections.
3. Similarly, the **UP**and **DOWN** arrow keys will adjust the volume. Press **UP** ;to raise and **DOWN** to decrease the level. Alternatively, you can press **;M** ;to mute the video.
4. You can also switch viewing methods by pressing **F**for full screen, **T** for theatre mode, and **I** for the mini player.
5. Other useful shortcuts are **C** activates the closed captions, and **SHIFT + N**skips to the next video.

### Refine your results with Advance Keyword Search

Since YouTube is a Google company, there is no doubt it has a world-class video search engine. Here are a few of them to help you get better search results.

1. **\-keyword**will omit all videos with a specific keyword from your search engine. For example, typing **Matchday Results -highlights** will eliminate all videos with the word highlight from your search results.
2. **Allintitle: Keyword1 keyword 2** generates video search results with both keywords in their title. For example, **allintitle: megan harry wedding**will only give you videos with all three keywords in the title.

### Always view YouTube with the best resolution. (Desktop)

Are you always changing the video quality for your YouTube videos? Well, you can rest free because you can customize the app to only play the best quality videos. Currently, the AV1 codec is the most popular video compression technology for the online video streaming industry.

Unfortunately, YouTube uses automatically selects your video quality in its default state. Here is how to always watch YouTube videos with the best resolution.

1. Log in to your YouTube account from your browser and proceed to **Settings**.
2. Once there, tap on the **Playback and Performance**option to access **AV1settings**.
3. Choose your preferred option and return to the homepage. Below are the available options.  
   * **Prefer AV1 for SD**, configuring YouTube to use AV1 compression for videos up to 480p and VP9 compression for higher resolutions.  
   * **Always Prefer AV1**, which requires a high-performance computer with a strong internet connection to stream videos in HD. Unfortunately, there is still limited AV1 content on YouTube. Therefore, most users prefer the previous option.

### Amazing Easter Eggs

Over the years, YouTube has featured some incredible easter eggs in the search engine. Easter eggs are specific keywords that activate crazy functions on the platform. However, not all of them last forever. Here is a list of the ones that are currently active:

1. Searching **Seinfeld Without People**presents you with a video result without a title or description.
2. Typing **awesome** while a video is playing makes the buffer start flashing. Please note the easter egg only works if you do not type in the comments or search box.
3. Alternatively, you can enter <https://www.youtube.com/robots.txt>to receive a secret message from the YouTube team.
4. Finally, when you search 301 views or 301 videos, the search results will feature a video by Numberphile that has been stuck there since it was first uploaded. It explains an earlier YouTube bug that caused the view counter to sticking at 301 views for several hours after uploading.

As you can see, YouTube is a versatile video upload platform, with plenty of cool features, provided you know where to access them. Keep checking with us for more insights on video and photo editing.
