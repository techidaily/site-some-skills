## First-hand review for DJI Spark

#### 1\.  Unboxing

You can easily pack it inside your travelling bag because the overall weight of this box goes only up to 500 grams where 95grams is the battery weight and 300grams is weight of your tiny aircraft. This is simply the best drone to have fun in a picnic with friends because it will not add extra bourdon to your luggage.

* Second option is to plug into the drone directly for charging
* Third and most commonly used one is to charge it via Micro USB slot.
