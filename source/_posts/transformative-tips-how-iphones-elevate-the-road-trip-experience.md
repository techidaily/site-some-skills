## 3  Phone as a Key 

 As cars continue to become more technologically advanced, many have come out with dedicated cell phone apps that can do anything from temperature control to location tracking.

 One recent trend in car-phone connectivity is [Phone as a Key](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/complete-tutorial-to-use-vpna-to-fake-gps-location-on-oppo-a78-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), technology included with some newer cars that allows you to unlock and start your car with only your phone. Going beyond remote-start features that have been around, this technology means you don't have to carry your keys with you to drive.

![Ford Mustang Mach-E app open to vehicle control page.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/img_d52e813ef024-1.jpg)
