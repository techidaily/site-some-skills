## 1  Parked Car Tracking 

 When visiting a busy area, like a grocery store, mall, or concert, it can be a pain to remember where you parked your car. Instead of running up and down rows of cars or frantically clicking your key fob to try and follow the beep, [your iPhone has you covered](https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/new-top-10-gaming-voice-modification-tools-rankings-and-analysis-for-2024/).

 If you have ever connected your phone to your car using Bluetooth or CarPlay, it can help you find your vehicle. To search for it, simply enter "Parked Car" into the Apple Maps search bar. From here, you can view your car on the map, as well as get directions to it.

## 3  Phone as a Key 

 As cars continue to become more technologically advanced, many have come out with dedicated cell phone apps that can do anything from temperature control to location tracking.

 One recent trend in car-phone connectivity is [Phone as a Key](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/complete-tutorial-to-use-vpna-to-fake-gps-location-on-oppo-a78-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), technology included with some newer cars that allows you to unlock and start your car with only your phone. Going beyond remote-start features that have been around, this technology means you don't have to carry your keys with you to drive.

![Ford Mustang Mach-E app open to vehicle control page.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/img_d52e813ef024-1.jpg)

Anyone with a car able to take advantage of this technology definitely should, as unlocking and starting your car with a single tap can save plenty of time and hassle.
