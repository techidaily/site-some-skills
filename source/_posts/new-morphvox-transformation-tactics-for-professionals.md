## MorphVOX Transformation Tactics for Professionals

In this era of vlogging and voice chatting, voice-faking programs like **MorphVOX voice changer** are in high demand. This desktop program can change your live voice to match your desired online character, whether voice chatting on Skype and Discord or playing on Steam and Valorant. But if you're looking to use MorphVOX, it's paramount to know that this program comes in two packages, the Junior and Pro versions. So, what's the difference between the Junior and Pro versions? Let's find out!

## Part 1\. What is MorphVOX Junior voice changer?

[MorphVOX Junior](https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-free-voice-changer) is a free, open-source voice changer for Windows systems. This voice changer is optimized for online gaming or pranking your friends on video and voice chats on apps like Skype, Meet Now, Zoom, and more.

You only need to select it as your input microphone to use it. MorphVOX Junior will enable you to convert your voice into a man, woman, or Tiny Folks. You can also customize your voice with background sound effects like an alarm clock, screech, cuckoo, and more.

However, this voice changer is best suited for entertainment than serious-business voice changing. That's because it's pretty basic in terms of everything. For example, you only get three voices and four sound effects. Other than that, it's an excellent free voice changer to have on your computer.

## Part 2\. What is MorphVOX Pro voice changer?

If you're unsatisfied with MorphVOX Junior, purchase [MorphVOX Pro](https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-voice-changer) for $39.99 only. Unlike the Junior version, this voice changer is compatible with macOS and Windows systems. It's super easy to set up and is compatible with a range of desktop apps, including CS:GO, Skype, Discord, and more.

But the Junior version doesn't come close when it comes to voice-changing capabilities. MorphVOX Pro will change your voice into tens of active voices, including a man, woman, robot, demon, droid, child, and more. You can even download more voice effects directly on the software.

Meanwhile, you can beautify your voice further using the multi-band graphic equalizer. Also, this professional voice changer boasts effective noise reduction and voice comparison capabilities. Voice parsing detection and stereo microphone are also supported. And yes, you can record the morphed voice and morph local sound files. All in all, this voice changer is worth every penny.

## Part 3\. How to use MorphVOX voice changer?

Up to this point, you must be eager to use the MorphVOX Junior and see if it's worth a try. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use MorphVOX Junior to change voices on Discord. For those who don't know, Discord is an instant messaging and VoIP app where users can share voice calls, video calls, media, and text messages. Although it's compatible with Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, we'll learn how to use it on Windows PC. Now follow me!

Step1 Assuming you already have a Discord account, head straight to Screamingbee.com and install MorphVOX Junior.

![download morphvox voice changer junior](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-3.jpg)

Step2 Once the app is up and running, head to Discord and click the **User Settings** icon at the bottom of the screen.

Step3 Then, tap **Voice & Video** before choosing the **Input Device** as **Screaming Bee Audio**. You can also adjust **Input Sensitivity** by disabling the feature and then speak to your mic to change the sensitivity accordingly.

Step4 Lastly, head to MorphVOX voice changer and choose a magic voice. Speak to your microphone, and that's it!

## Part 4\. How to use MorphVOX voice changer on Mac?

As said earlier, MorphVOX Junior is only compatible with Windows PCs. So, in this section, we want to learn how to use **MorphVOX on Mac**. I guess that means purchasing the Pro version. However, you'll enjoy unlimited voice-changing capabilities. So, wasting time, here are the steps:

Step1 Go to Screamingbee.com and install MorphVOX Pro for macOS. This program runs on Mac OS X 10.6 or newer. After installing, complete the purchase by requesting a product key.

![down morphvox voice changer pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-6.jpg)

Step2 Now go back to MorphVOX Pro and choose an active voice. You can speak like a woman, man, robot, hell demon, or dog translator. If the available voice options are insufficient, click **Tools** and tap **Manage Voices Pack**. Now you can download and install new voice packs conveniently from within the program. Just tap the **Download** button to download the voice pack.

Step3 Next, let's set MorphVOX Pro to work on Skype. To do that, tap the **Preferences** menu on Skype and click the **Audio/Video** tab. Then, change the microphone to **MorphVOX Audio**. Now make your Skype call using the new voice.

## Part 5\. FAQs about MorphVOX voice changer

### Why is the MorphVOX voice changer not working?

There can be several solutions for MorphVOX not running on your program. First, make sure you select the program as the voice input device on Skype, Discord, Steam, or whatever voice-sharing app you're using. Secondly, adjust the microphone levels.

### Is MorphVOX Pro a good buy?

Yes, MorphVOX Pro is worth every penny you pay for it. This professional-grade voice changer has unlimited voice-changing capabilities that you won't find anywhere else.

### How do I solve sound distortion when using MorphVOX?

If you hear distorted sound while faking your voice on MorphVOX, try adjusting the microphone sound level to find the right balance. Also, be sure to use a silent room for the best output.

### What are the best MorphVOX voice changer alternatives?

If MorphVOX doesn't cut it for you, try Clownfish Voice Changer, a free voice-changing software for desktops. Other reliable alternatives include VoiceMeeter, Voxal Voice Changer, MagicMic, and VoiceMod.

### The sum up

Now you know the difference between MorphVOX Junior and MorphVOX Pro. Although the Junior version is free, it's only compatible with Windows PCs, whereas the Pro version offers Mac compatibility. Also, the Pro version provides numerous voice effects, sound effects, EQ, and more. But in the end, it depends if you're willing to pay for MorphVOX Pro. Make a choice!
