## Mozilla Firefox Enhances User Experience with New Features: Vertical Tabs & Advanced Tab Groups

In a world where all browsers are using the Chromium engine, Mozilla's Firefox prides itself in being the odd one out. Firefox gets new features and performance improvements on a regular basis, and now Mozilla has confirmed a few upcoming changes coming to the browser.

 Mozilla is rolling out a few updates to [Firefox](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-guide-to-instagram-video-backup-with-computer-or-laptop/), which will be rolling out in a future update, while also talking about stuff that the company wants to implement. Responding to user feedback, Mozilla is prioritizing productivity by adding features such as Tab Grouping, Vertical Tabs, and a Sidebar, all of which will be great if you happen to be of the kind to have multiple tabs open. Instead of having a bunch of tabs cramped on the top of your screen, you can just scroll down through the renewed vertical tab interface, similar to Edge or Vivaldi. There will also be a new Profile Management feature that will keep your work, school, and personal profiles separate, which sounds like the account switcher currently available in Chrome and Edge. You can also expect customizable new tab wallpapers and privacy settings.

 Mozilla is also working on faster page loads, quicker startup times, and reduced battery consumption on mobile devices. Collaborative efforts with the Interop project aim to improve cross-browser compatibility, and new features will enable users to report website functionality issues directly to Mozilla. Mozilla says that it remains committed to user privacy, ensuring that essential features like translation and PDF editing are handled locally on the device, protecting user data from being exploited by third parties.

 The company is also exploring the use of AI in Firefox, prioritizing on-device AI models to enhance the browsing experience while respecting user privacy. One upcoming feature is AI-generated alt-text for images in PDFs, improving accessibility for visually impaired users and people with learning disabilities. Other browsers are experimenting with similar local AI models, and Chrome even plans to [allow web apps to use them](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in).

 Mozilla didn't mention in which updates these new features will be available, so just keep your Firefox browser updated to see the changes as they happen. If you don't have it already, you can [download Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) from Mozilla's website.
