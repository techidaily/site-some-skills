In this day and age, quite a lot of eBooks can be found in epub format. But how do you transfer epub file to your iPad or iPhone so you can read them on iPhone? Don't worry if you don't know the answer. Because in this article I will show you how to copy your EPUB files on your iPhone without any effort.

## Make Sure Your EPUB Files are DRM Free

First you need to download [Adobe Digital Editions for PC/MAC](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html) which supports PDF/EPUB format on your computer, then authorize it with your Adobe ID(if you don't have one, create new Adobe ID). Then open the EPUB file which you want to transfer to your iPhone with ADE to see if you can open it. If you can, it means it has no DRM. If not, you need to remove its DRM before transferring it to iPhone. 

You can find [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) on the internet which is a very helpful eBook DRM Removal as well as eBook converter tool. Even if your books are DRM protected Kindle/Nook/Kobo books, etc, Epubor Ultimate can help you [decrypt these eBooks and convert to epub format](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). Most important, you can try the free trial to figure it by yourself.

### Copy epub to iPhone with iTunes

The last 12.7 update is huge! And there’s been a lot of fuss about the latest 12.7 iTunes update. Looks like Apple is finally slowly, step by step is trying to make iTunes easier to use. This is a big step forward. New iTunes looks better and is way easier to navigate. So here’s a quick guide about how to get new ePub file to appear on the iBooks reader on iPad or iPhone.

#### Method 1 — Drag epub files to iPhone directly.

Step 1open iTunes & plug in your iPhone.

If you are a Window user, you need to download the latest [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) version to your computer first. If you are a Mac user, you need to update iTunes to the latest version. Then launch iTunes and connect your iPhone to your computer via USB. Then you will see a device icon on iTunes, see the below picture.

![connect iphone to itunes](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/connect-iphone-to-itunes.png)

Step 2click the iOS device icon, you make sure to go to **Summary** to check **Manually manage music and videos** under **Options**. Then click **Sync** and **Done** button. It may take some time to sync the content from your iPhone to iTunes. So please wait patiently.

![mannually manage music and videos](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/mannually-manage-music-and-videos.png)

Step 3click **Books** in the left sidebar of iTunes. Then locate the epub files that you want to transfer to your iPhone. Last, drag and drop the epub books from your computer to iTunes. See the below picture.

![drag epub to itunes](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/drag-epub-to-itunes.png)

Step 4it may take some time to sync the epub files to your iPhone. After the synchronization you will see the epub files on the iBook reader on iPhone.

You may notice that now transferring epub files to iPhone with the latest iTunes version is way easier than before. 

#### Method 2 — File Sharing

Step 1open iTunes on your computer and plug in your iOS device. Then click the device icon on iTunes. 

Step 2click **File Sharing** in the left sidebar of iTunes. You will see a list of apps which allow you to transfer documents between your iPhone and this computer.

![file sharing](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/file-sharing.png)

Step 3add epub books to your preferred reader app which supports epub format files. Take ADE for example, you can transfer your epub files to iPhone by just dragging epub files to Digital Edition Document folder or clicking **Add File** to copy epub files to third party reader apps.

![add epub file to ade](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/add-epub-file-to-ade.png)

If you use method 1 to transfer epub files to iPhone, you can only read the epub files on iBook. But if you use method 2, you can use epub support third party apps to read the epub files. 

#### Method 3 — transfer epub to iPhone wirelessly

You can only use iTunes to transfer epub to iPhone wirelessly if you are using an old version iTunes(before the 12.7 version). If you are using to the latest version iTunes and want to transfer epub files to iPhone wirelessly, you need to uninstall the latest iTunes and install the old version iTunes.

Step 1for iTunes Wi-Fi sync, your iPhone needs to connect to Wi-Fi. At the same time, you need to go to **Summary** on iTunes to check **Sync with this iPhone over Wi-Fi** after plugging in your iPhone to your computer. Then click **Apply**. After that you can unplug your iPhone. You may need to restart your computer in order to sync your iPhone with iTunes. 

**Note: you only need to plug in your iPhone once in order to check Sync with this iPhone over Wi-Fi function. So iTunes can sync with your iPhone over Wi-Fi automatically without connecting iPhone to your computer with USB cable next time.**

![sync with this iphone over wifi](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/sync-with-this-iphone-over-wifi.png)

Step 2add epub files to iTunes by clicking the small icon on the left upper corner of iTunes. Then click **Add File to Library** in the drop-down menu.

Then click **Sync Books** to choose whether you want to sync **All books** or only **Selected books**. Next check the books you want to sync to iPhone. Last, click **Sync** button to start syncing the checked books to iPhone. 

![sync books and apply](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/sync-books-and-apply.png)

It will pop up a window. You need to click **Erase and Sync**. Then iTunes will start looking for your iPhone.

The best website to explain this ever! I wasn't being able to transfer epubs to my iPhone because the manually manage musics and videos wasn't selected. So if anyone out there is having the same issue, check if you have that option marked.   
 Thank you very much for this article!

This is EXACTLY why apple is so far behind everyone else. If Literally any other company made their customers jump through hoops like this just to get files to open on their device they wouldn't sell.

 I'm glad this trick worked, I thought I had idiots for readers who didn't know how to open a simple file, I should have known that Apple was just as backwards and obtuse today as it was 10 years ago.
