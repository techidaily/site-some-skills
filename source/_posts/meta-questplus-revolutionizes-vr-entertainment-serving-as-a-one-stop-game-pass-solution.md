## Meta Quest+ Revolutionizes VR Entertainment, Serving as a One-Stop Game Pass Solution!

There aren't as many games available for Meta Quest VR headsets as there are for traditional game consoles and PCs, but picking a new game to spend money on and play still isn't easy. Meta Quest+ was introduced as a subscription service that gives you two games each month for one fixed monthly rate, and now it works a bit more like Microsoft's Game Pass subscription on Xbox and PC.

 Meta is adding a new games catalog to [Quest+](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-the-art-of-video-clarity-with-version-22-vce/) on March 1st. This expanded collection will encompass a diverse range of game genres, from action and adventure to RPGs, strategy, and puzzlers. The catalog will feature rotating titles to ensure a constant stream of fresh content for users. With this, Meta wants to bring Quest+ closer to [Game Pass](https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-4-solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro/). Up until now, the platform offered access to a couple of games every month for its flat monthly fee, that you got to keep forever for as long as you remained subscribed. Now, this catalog will give you access to a rotating selection of games.

 Meta might choose to put more popular/attractive games here that it might not feel like giving away to users indefinitely. It's starting with 24 games such as _Fruit Ninja_ and _The Climb_, and as we said before, some games will be added (and others potentially removed) over the coming months. The games catalog is not replacing the current modelâ€”you should still be getting your two monthly games.

 On top of this or those considering a subscription, Meta Quest+ offers enticing deals. From March 1 to May 31, purchasing or upgrading to an annual subscription for $59.99 provides subscribers with $25 in store credit that lets them enhance their library further with new game purchases. New subscribers can also take advantage of special promotions, such as the first month free until December 31, followed by the usual monthly subscription fee of $7.99\. Additionally, purchasers of the 512GB Meta Quest 3 receive a complimentary six-month trial of Meta Quest+.

 If you want to check Meta Quest+ out, make sure to go to [Meta's website](https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/meta-quest-plus-terms/) to know more. This new game catalog will certainly make the service more attractive to many.
