However, some of the podcasters with shows on Apple Podcasts do offer premium episodes, shows, and channels. People can subscribe to their channels with a specified fee that the creator sets on a monthly or yearly payment schedule.

Users that want to access these premium/bonus episodes, ad-free listening, get faster access to their archives and get a first look at new shows can opt for the subscription. The costs can vary as per the channels, with some offering a 7-day trial and USD 3.99 per month or other offers.

Now that you know the right steps to download Apple Podcasts on different devices, the question comes- where to access them? The downloaded episodes of the podcast show you save will go into the Downloaded tab of the app. This happens for both PC and mobile users.

## Part 5\. Why Can't I Download Podcasts on Apple Podcasts?

### Issue 1: Temporary glitches

Sometimes, the main reason why users cannot download their Apple podcasts on the app is due to some temporary glitches. They are not easy to detect or prevent, but the issue itself is relatively low on the danger scale. However, it can suddenly stop some apps from operating, like the Podcast app.

**Fix: Force-quit Apple Podcast App**

The best solution to remove this issue will include force-quitting the app and then reopening the app again.

Step1 Go to the App Switcher feature on your iPhone. In case the iPhone model you are using comes with Face ID, you can swipe up the screen from the bottom and pause for some seconds before bringing it fully up.

Otherwise, you should double-tap on the Home button.

Step2 Choose the app card for Apple Podcasts app. Swipe it up and choose the force quit option. Wait for some time, and then start the app again.

![choose the app card](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/force-quit-apple-podcast.jpg)

### Issue 2: Server-side issues

Sometimes, users cannot download Apple Podcasts due to server-side problems in the software. That can potentially block the steady downloading process. You should check the System Status section on your Apple site to check the system condition in this case.

**Fix: Evaluate system status insights**

Open the System Status page from Apple's official website via your chosen browser. See if all systems are operating smoothly.

![open the system status page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/fix-evaluate-system-status-insights.jpg)

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If there are issues in the services like App Store (for Apple Podcasts, this will appear since there is no separate listing for apps) or Apple ID. In case some appear, wait some time. the services will come back online automatically eventually.

### Issue 3: Not connecting to or unavailable Wi-Fi

It is better to choose other networks for users who are not using an active Wi-Fi connection, or the connection is not stable. Allow permissions for accessing the cellular data in your device to the Podcast app instead.

**Fix: Choose cellular data instead**

The steps for activating Cellular data access permission are as follows:

Step1 On your device, click on Settings. Then, choose the Podcasts option.

Step2 Check if the Cellular Data access is active on the app. If not, enable it.

Step3 Disable the "Block Downloads Over Cellular" option if already enabled.

![disable the block downloads over the cellular option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/disable-the-block-downloads-over-the-cellular-option.jpg)

### Issue 4: Bad network connection error

Sometimes, the main cause of the failure to download Apple podcast episodes occurs due to connection issues directly. In this case, users continuously notice problems while trying to download their Podcasts app.

**Fix: Reset the network settings**

You should change your network settings completely to resolve this issue. You will not lose any available data. However, the process involves setting up the Wi-Fi connections fully from the ground-up, so follow the instructions on the screen very carefully.

Go to the Settings menu on your iPhone device and click on the General option. Then, press the Reset option and choose the Reset Network Settings selection.
