## OnePlus Tablet 2 Unveiled Featuring Superior 3K Display & Advanced Snapdragon Processor

Last year, OnePlus finally announced its very first tablet, the OnePlus Pad. It was everything you expected from a OnePlus phone, except a larger form factor. We found it to be pretty good. Now, OnePlus is coming out with a successor, and it also looks quite decent.

 OnePlus has launched its latest tablet, the Pad 2, as a successor to [its very first offering](https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/expertise-meets-simplicity-effortless-graphic-driver-update-on-windows-os/). On the surface, you might not notice much, as it actually even has an almost identical design to its predecessor. The company went for the same metal unibody it used the last time—if it's not broken, then there's no need to fix it. There are some internal changes, though. The tablet is boasting a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor (the last tablet used a MediaTek chip, so this is likely a huge upgrade for a lot of people), a 12.1-inch 3K display, 12GB of RAM, and six stereo speakers.

 OnePlus says that the tablet is designed to enhance productivity through several AI-powered features, including AI Speak for text-to-speech conversion, Recording Summary for condensing lengthy texts, and AI Writer for generating content from image and text prompts. You can also just use it for normal Android tablet stuff.

 The OnePlus Pad 2 also puts a lot of priority on its battery life and charging speeds, as it's usual with OnePlus hardware. Its 9,510mAh battery promises up to 43 days of standby time and can be fully charged in 81 minutes using the 67W SUPERVOOC Flash Charge technology. Those are the same exact specs we saw in its predecessor, and while we had no complaints on that front, the other hardware changes here might change how well Flash Charge works. OnePlus is also introducing two new accessories to complement the tablet: the OnePlus Stylo 2 and the OnePlus Pad 2 Smart Keyboard.

 The tablet starts at $499.99, and you can [pre-order it from OnePlus](https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/5597632/916678/12532?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2004203&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Fbuy-oneplus-pad-2).
