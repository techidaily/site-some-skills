## Part 1\. Popular Meme Ideas

An internet meme maker is no longer required to create memes. Coming up with a very amazing concept and turning it into a beautiful work of meme art is more delicate than that and requires your undivided attention. To ensure your product is the greatest, regardless of whether you use Photoshop or paint, you need to concentrate on the key aspects. Use the following tips to learn the best tactic:

### Memejacking

Memejacking is using these famous memes as a mode of transportation. Many memes last for weeks, months, or even years, but a brand-new meme is always spreading. Jumping on current trends while they're new and, most crucially, relevant is the key to meme success. Memes that are the result of singular incidents are ideal for this. Everyone shares as many of them as they can when they first appear, but once the meme is finished, it is over.

### "No One" Meme

The "no one" meme is certainly one you've seen flying around the internet. Its purpose is to suggest an unusual or bizarre notion that no one requested in the first place or to draw attention to an oddity that everyone shares but that goes unmentioned, such as turning down the radio in the vehicle while checking up directions.

![no one meme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/no-one-meme.jpg)

### Contrasting Memes

When we use our talents of observation and identify a connection between two things, humor sometimes results. Then we create a side-by-side comparison meme to communicate that realization to the rest of the globe. The audience also values well-written, concise conversation. Be inventive, but stick to the proven strategies you are familiar with.

![contrasting memes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/contrasting-memes.jpg)

### Relatable Memes

For a meme to gain significant popularity, it doesn't always have to be utterly humorous. The finest memes sometimes do a fantastic job of encapsulating a certain mood that we can all relate to. By connecting this kind of meme to the issues that their goods address, brands may evoke a deep emotional reaction.

![relatable memes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/relatable-meme.jpg)

### Text In Outline Meme

There aren't any absolute laws in the domain of memes. Maybe all you want to do with a wonderful photograph is add some text, particularly if it's the traditional white font with a black outline. Additionally, a silly animal picture is always a good choice.

![text in outline meme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-in-outline-meme.jpg)

### Evolving Memes

Memes cover a wide range of subjects, from commonplace issues to significant national and international events. Every day, more are produced and shared, and fresh content is always accessible. Some memes come from contentious forums, while others could use unpleasant stereotypes. A good rule of thumb is to conduct some study before employing a meme if you're unsure of what it refers to or why it's meant to be humorous.

![evolving memes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/evolving-memes.jpg)

### Solitary Words

One picture and one phrase form the basis of this meme. Make them interact. Emphasize the meme in it. Memes have a huge following that is inclined to like and spread the material. One worder memes may be effective icebreakers, even in the somewhat stuffy world of B2B marketing. They present your brand to customers in a manner that stands out and fosters favorable connections.

![solitary words](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solitary-words.jpg)

### Kid Success Memes

A meme that has endured for years is Success Kid. There is no required wording for this one; instead, it serves as a model for any very lucky break you know will connect with your audience.
