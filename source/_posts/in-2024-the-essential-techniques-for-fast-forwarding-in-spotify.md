## The Essential Techniques for Fast-Forwarding in Spotify

While listening to songs has become relatively easy nowadays with so many audio streaming platforms like Spotify available, controlling their specifications has yet to. However, for many users, this is a significant concern.

After all, faster-paced songs are more engaging and high-energy, invoking feelings of fun and excitement in people. This is one of the reasons why the sped-up songs on videos posted on social media platforms like TikTok are so catchy and shareable.

If you want a fast-paced song version but not necessarily a pre-made remix with extra effects, manually speeding it up should help**.**

If that is a concern for you, worry not. This post will detail the best solutions and software to **speed up music on Spotify** using its rich library of songs, with steps. Let's continue.

## Part I. How to Speed Up Songs on Spotify?

Firstly, consider if the process of **changing a song's speed on Spotify** is directly applicable to the platform. The answer to that is no. As of the time of this writing, Spotify or any of the well-known online audio streaming sites still need to offer the music playback speed adjustment feature. This applies to both web and mobile versions while streaming songs.

While there is no direct function for adjusting Spotify songs or even podcasts' playback speed, you can use the [Spotify Playback Speed Access](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spotify-playback-speed-ac/cgbihpjbhpdfbdckcabcniojdhcgblhd) of Spotify Web Player. This is a Google Chrome extension that allows users the ability to **speed up Spotify songs**, mainly on the web app version.

However, this extension was last updated in October 2019\. So, while using it, you might notice some issues.

### Method 1: Change Playback Speed on Spotify Web Player

The following are the main steps you should follow to **Spotify speed up music via the Spotify Web Player:**

Step1: Go to Google Chrome Web Store and search for the Spotify Playback Speed Access extension.

Step2: Tap the "Add to Chrome" button.

Step3: Access the Spotify web player on your device and access the Spotify account by logging in.

Step4: Tap on the triangle icon and increase/decrease the playback speed of the songs while listening.

### Method 2: Speed Up/Slow Down Audio Files on Spotify App

It is also possible to **slow down the music app Spotify** using the solution, but mainly for podcasts, not songs. Here are the main steps for the process.

**For mobile users:**

Step1: Open the Spotify app on your smartphone > choose a podcast.

## Part II. How to Change Speed of Audio on Spotify for Further Video Editing- Full Guide

When it comes to Spotify and its users, many utilize the software for more than just music playback or listening to podcasts. Some users require songs from worldwide creators available on Spotify for video editing. This is because of the vast library of high-quality music types on the software.

Adding a soundtrack to the video can favorably enhance scenes in videos, like a romantic tune for a honeymoon video or catchy tunes for product promotion projects. So, to **change the song's speed, Spotify** users should know the steps and use the appropriate software to download the music for video-based editing.

It is possible to do so in two phases- downloading the songs offline using specific apps on different platforms. Then, you must utilize high-quality video editing software to apply it to the video of your choice. Let's discuss the steps for both.

##### Step1Download the music from Spotify

The first level related to **Spotify speeding up songs** for video editing is getting the audio track from the Spotify library.

##### On Desktop - Using [Musify](https://itubego.com/music-mp3-downloader-66/)

Step5: Tap on the Download button.

##### On Mobile - Using [Spotify Premium](https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/)

Spotify offers both the free and Premium versions to users. Those with a Premium account can download songs for offline listening and use them in the best quality available. Users with one of the premium cost plans can also get benefits like no ads between the songs playing in sequence, something that free versions users deal with often.

##### Step2Import the Audio File to Filmora

## FAQs about Spotify Music

1. **Can I listen to Spotify music for free?**

Yes, the Spotify platform does come in the free version with a vast library of songs and podcasts for users to listen to. However, you cannot download the audio files and must use a stable and active internet connection to stream the songs. Plus, ads keep coming up in intervals consistently.

1. **Where is the Spotify music stored on my phone?**

When users download music on Spotify through the mobile app, the songs save within the app. So, you have to open the app to hear the songs. This is because the cache of the songs downloads when users save them offline from Spotify. For example, the download location on Android phones is the Spotify app's inbuilt Android data folder.

## Conclusion

Spotify is one of the best apps available for high-quality music playback of various types. However, it only allows users to change the music speed and podcasts directly. So, you have to use an extension to adjust the playback speed of songs or upgrade to a Premium paid account.

Besides that, you can use separate apps like Musify and Filmora to download songs from Spotify and edit them into videos. The steps for each option are mentioned- follow them carefully to ensure the best results with the process.
