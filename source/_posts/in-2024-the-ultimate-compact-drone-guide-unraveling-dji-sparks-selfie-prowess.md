#### 1\.  Unboxing

This is simply the best drone to have fun in a picnic with friends because it will not add extra bourdon to your luggage.

Spark use to follow its owner in air, and it's incredibly advanced design technology let it behave like an intelligent unit. It understands your gestures and move accordingly.

* Gesture

You make a rectangle in air using your fingers and your intelligent drone will capture a selfie for you. But note that, this feature works only up to 3 meters distance.
