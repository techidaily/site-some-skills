## July 16, 2024 Marks the Start of Amazon Prime Day Shopping Extravaganza

Here we go again. This year's Prime Day shopping event begins July 16th and ends the night of July 17th, although early deals and promotional offers are available today.

 The [Prime Day landing page](https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003804&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fprime-day-2024-begins-july-16th%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) already contains a collection of early discounts and invite-only deals. Some discounts are available to all users, though invite-only deals require a Prime subscription and won't go live until July 16th or 17th. If you're a Prime subscriber, now's the time to request an invitation for some invite-only deals, as they are only available to a limited number of customers.

 Amazon is also offering a five-month free trial for its [Music Unlimited](https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003804&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fprime-day-2024-begins-july-16th%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) service, a Prime members can secure a three-month trial for [Kindle Unlimited](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003804&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fprime-day-2024-begins-july-16th%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) or [Audible Premium Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Books-and-Originals/b/?node=18145289011&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003804&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fprime-day-2024-begins-july-16th%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). If you're a Prime Member with Grubhub+, you can get a $10 gift card after spending $25 on food (with a [coupon code](https://slickdeals.net/f/17578764-amazon-prime-members-spend-25-on-grubhub-orders-receive-10-amazon-gift-card-via-amazon-valid-thru-7-15?src=frontpage%5Frecombee&prop=rcmid-e257983829210949020830de0676c86e)).

 I'm pretty impressed by some of Amazon's early Prime Day deals. You can save $300 on the [M3 MacBook Air](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX23V2ZK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003804&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fprime-day-2024-begins-july-16th%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), for example, or grab a [Roku Express HD](https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Express-Streaming-High-Speed-controls/dp/B0BCH5H2R3/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003804&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fprime-day-2024-begins-july-16th%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) for just $18\. Though I should warn that discounts can be deceptive—a deal [isn't always a deal](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-virtual-meetups-made-simple-setting-up-video-calls-with-whatsapp-on-your-laptop/). The M3 MacBook Air is a great example of this phenomenon, as it was on sale with a $400 discount just one week ago.

 So, instead of going buck-wild and buying a bunch of random crap on Prime Day, I strongly suggest that you prepare ahead of time. Build a wishlist of items that you want to buy on sale (try to think of gifts that you can give later in the year), and if you're a Prime member, set up deal alerts in the Amazon Shopping app. Once the Prime Day festivities are in full swing, use [CamelCamelCamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/) to check the price history of items. You may find that the Prime Day pricing is higher than that of previous sales.

 And you don't need to limit yourself to shopping at Amazon. Retailers like Walmart and Best Buy regularly encroach on Prime Day with their own sales events. Personally, I use [Slickdeals](https://slickdeals.net/) for deal notifications, as it'll send me an alert when certain items go on sale at _any_ retailer.
