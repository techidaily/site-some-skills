## SwiftSoundphone Apps: Top 10 for Rapid Music

When you watch videos, what do you prefer more- those with slowed-down beats or fast-paced audio that revs up the excitement? For most people, it is the latter, which is why short Tiktok or Instagram videos with peppy background music get so much engagement. Faster songs bring out the energy and are memorable and passionate.

So, if you are editing videos you want to use for advertising products, a tutorial video, or a fun edit, speeding up the audio should help you. You can use an excellent **audio speed changer** to properly increase the sound speed of different songs quickly, without quality loss or cracking during the playback.

Multiple useful options are available in the market that promises high-quality audio speed adjustment functions. In this post, we shall look into apps and software with this function on mobile devices and desktops, discussing their features and how to use them.
