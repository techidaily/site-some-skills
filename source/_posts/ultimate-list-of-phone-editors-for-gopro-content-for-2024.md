### 8\. [GoFix](https://gofix-remove-distortion-from-gopro-photos-ios.soft112.com/modal-download.html)

Though your action camera would allow you to take photos in situations in which most other cameras won't allow, your photos are going to be a bit distorted because of the fisheye effect on GoPro. Though many of us prefer the fisheye look, you can always choose to do away with it by using the GoFix app. With the GoFix app, you no longer need to worry about those curved horizons.
