**Supports Collage:** you can create beautiful collages and use as many photos as you want. The ability to individually add various backgrounds and effects to each of the photos is what I find so interesting about this function.

**Large Pool of Resourceful Effects:** Samsung photo editor has a lot of beautiful effects that can give your photos the unique, beautiful, and trendy look you desire.
