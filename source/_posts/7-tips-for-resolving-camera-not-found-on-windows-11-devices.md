##  1\. Restart Your Computer

 If you encounter the "We can't find your camera" error, your first step should be to [restart your computer](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-15-must-use-hashtags-for-popularity-on-instagram-feed/). This is because a temporary glitch in the Windows Camera app can sometimes cause the error message.

![We can't find your camera error message on the Camera app](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/we-can-t-find-your-camera-error-message.jpg) 

 Restarting your computer will reload all the running processes and usually eliminates any bugs or glitches that might be causing problems, including the camera error.

 To restart your Windows PC, press the Alt+F4 keys together to open the "Shut Down Windows" dialog box. Then, select "Restart" from the drop-down menu and click "OK."

![Restart option in the Shut Down Windows](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/restart-option.jpg) 

 After your computer restarts, open the Camera app and check if the error message still appears. If it does, continue with the next troubleshooting method.

##  2\. Ensure the Camera Is Connected Properly

 If you're using an [external webcam](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-essential-fix-re-emerge-missing-watch-icon-2023/), ensure it's properly connected to your computer. Inspect both ends of the cable for any loose connections and verify that the connecting cable is in good condition.

 If everything appears to be in order, unplug your camera from the port it's currently connected to and plug it into a different port. If the camera starts working, it indicates an issue with the original port. In this case, you should take your device to a technician for port repair.

##  3\. Ensure the Camera Is Enabled In the Device Manager

 Windows allows you to enable or disable your camera manually. Consequently, when you attempt to launch the Camera app with your device camera disabled, you will encounter the error message "We Can't Find your Camera."

 In this case, verify that your camera is not disabled. To check that, press the Windows+X keys together and select "Device Manager" from the context menu.

![Device Manager in the PowerUser menu](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/device-manager-1.jpg) 

 Within [Device Manager](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-easily-record-lenovo-laptop-screen-activity/), expand the "Cameras" category.

![Cameras category in the Device Manager](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cameras-category.jpg) 

 Next, [right-click](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-recording-fun-6-techniques-to-document-minecraft-for-2024/) on your camera and check the context menu that appears. If the option to "Enable Device" is available, it indicates that your camera is disabled. To activate the camera, select the "Enable Device" option.

![Enable Device option in the Device Manager](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/enable-device-option-1.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Now, close the Device Manager and check for the issue.

##  4\. Use the Camera Troubleshooter

 The Windows Camera Troubleshooter is a helpful utility that can resolve most camera-related issues, including the one you're encountering. To use this utility, open the "Settings" app (check out different ways to [access the Settings app on Windows](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-5-easy-ways-to-multiply-your-youtube-follower-base/)), choose "System" from the left sidebar and "Troubleshoot" from the right pane.

![Troubleshoot option in the Settings app](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/troubleshoot-option-2.jpg) 

 Click "Other Troubleshooters."

![Other Troubleshooters option in the Settings app](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/other-troubleshooters.jpg) 

 Click "Run" next to the Camera option.

![Run option next to the Camera app](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/run-option-1.jpg) 

 A Get Help window will appear. Click "Yes" to grant permission for automated diagnostics to be run.

![Yes option in the Get Help window](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/yes-option.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 The Get Help window will proceed to perform necessary fixes. Once completed, restart your device and check if the issue persists. If it does, consider using the Windows built-in repair and reset feature.

##  5\. Repair or Reset the Camera App

 The repair and reset feature is a troubleshooting tool that allows you to address issues with UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps that are not functioning properly. The [repair feature](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/swift-closure-of-a-linkedin-account-the-how-to-guide-for-2024/) clears the app's cache data, while the [reset feature](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-comprehensive-guide-to-producing-videos-for-social-media/) deletes the app's entire data to resolve the issue.

 You should always prioritize the repair option first, as it attempts to rectify the issue without deleting the app's data. However, if repairing the app doesn't resolve the problem, you can proceed with the reset option.

 To repair the Camera app, open the Settings menu, click "Apps", and then click the "Installed Apps" option in the right pane.

![Installed Apps option in the Settings app](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/installed-apps-option.jpg) 

 Click the three dots next to the "Camera" app and choose "Advanced Options" from the menu that appears.

![Advanced Options in the Context menu](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/advanced-options.jpg) 

 Click the "Repair" button.

![Repair option in the Settings app](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/repair-option-1.jpg) 

 Windows will attempt to repair the app. Once the repair process is complete, a checkmark will appear next to the Repair button. Subsequently, launch the Camera app and check if it's functioning correctly. If you're still encountering the error message, you'll need to reset the Camera app.

![Checkmark next to the Camera app](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/checkmark.jpg) 

 To reset the Camera app, click the "Reset" option.

![Reset option in the Settings app](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/reset-option-1.jpg) 

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087248/19272" target="_top" id="2087248">

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Windows will reset the Camera app. Once the reset process is complete, another checkmark will appear next to the Reset button. After that, launch the Camera app, and the issue should be resolved.

##  6\. Check Your Antivirus Settings

 If you have a [third-party antivirus program](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-access-high-res-fb-media-files/) installed on your computer, ensure your Camera app is not included in its blocked list. If it is, you may encounter the "We can't find your camera" error when opening the Camera app.

 The steps to check the blocked apps list vary depending on the antivirus program. So, check your antivirus program's user manual to learn how to block or unblock an app in it.

 If you have Avast antivirus installed, you can remove the Camera app from its blocked list by opening Avast Antivirus and clicking the "Menu" option in the top bar.

![Menu option in Avast antivirus](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/menu-option.jpg) 

 Then, choose "Settings" from the menu that appears.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Click the "Blocked & Allowed Apps" option in the left sidebar.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Check if the Windows Camera app is in the blocked app list. If it is, click the three dots next to the app and choose the "Remove" option.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 After that, close the antivirus program. You should now be able to use the Camera app.

##  7\. Update the Camera Driver

 If you're still encountering the issue, you should check for and download any available camera driver updates. Camera issues often arise from outdated drivers. In such cases, updating the camera driver to its latest version is the most effective solution.

 To update the camera driver, open the "Settings" app, click on "Windows Update", and select "Advanced Options" in the right pane.

![Advanced options in Windows Update](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/advanced-options-in-windows-update.jpg) 

 Under "Additional Options," click on "Optional Updates."

![Optional Updates option in the Settings app](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/optional-updates-option.jpg) 

 Expand the "Driver Updates" section and check for any available updates for your camera. The camera update will have the name of the camera installed on your device. For example, if you have an HP True Vision camera installed, the update name will likely be "HP-Camera," followed by the update version.

 Select the checkbox next to the camera update and click the "Download & Install" button to download and install the update.

 If the [optional updates](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-gsm-flasher-adb-legit-full-review-to-bypass-your-lava-yuva-2-profrp-lock-by-drfone-android/) section doesn't show any available driver updates for your camera, you can visit your computer manufacturer's website and download any available updates for your camera driver.

 Hopefully, the solutions provided above have helped you resolve the error, and you can now use the camera app without any issues. If it didn't, you should try your camera on another PC. If the camera doesn't work on a different PC either, the problem is likely with the camera itself. It may be broken, and if it is, you'll likely have to replace it.
