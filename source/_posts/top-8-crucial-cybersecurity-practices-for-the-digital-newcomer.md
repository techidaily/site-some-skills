 Entering the tech world can be thrilling but presents numerous risks. From falling prey to hackers to inadvertently sharing sensitive information, your privacy and finances can be compromised.

 Phishing is a common tactic hackers use to infect or gain unauthorized access to your devices or accounts. To protect yourself, you have to be familiar with the [signs of fraudulent emails](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-permanent-name-shift-on-google-meet-devices/) and texts. Check the sender's email address or phone number to ensure it's legitimate. Scammers use slight variations, such as replacing "PayPal" with "PayPak" or "PayPaI" (with a capital I and not a lowercase L), which can be _easily_ overlooked.

 Fraudulent emails and texts often include generic greetings like "Dear Customer" instead of using your name. They may contain spelling and grammar mistakes, force you to take urgent action, add malicious links, attach malicious files that you should not download, or direct you to websites that look official but have slightly different URLs.

 By being viligant for these signs, you can identify phishing attempts and avoid falling victim to them.

[Tech support scams](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/full-range-virtual-sphere-review/) are among the most common traps scammers use to deceive non-tech-savvy individuals.

 Scammers typically display a fake popup on your screen while you're browsing an unsafe website, claiming that your computer is infected or has a severe issue. They then ask you to call a number listed in the popup, which connects you to the scammers. When you call, they ask for remote access to your computer, claiming they need it to fix the issue.

 Once they have access, they may turn your screen black, transfer funds from your bank account (if they can), install malicious software, or use other tactics to defraud you. To protect yourself, ignore such popups and _never_ allow anyone remote access to your device. If you need genuine tech support, always seek assistance from the official website of the company.

## 3  Avoid Befriending Strangers Online 

 Social media and online communities are rife with scammers. Therefore, it's crucial never to befriend strangers you’ve never met. Only connect with people you know in real life. Also, ensure you don’t connect with an impersonator. Always verify that the profile is authentic, check mutual connections, and don’t accept friend requests from newly created profiles.

 Also, avoid responding to or acting on generic messages, and don’t fall for emotional stories. Never share personal information if someone requests it. Likewise, [be wary of anyone recommending investment schemes promising high returns](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-quick-guide-to-concisely-editing-youtube-videos/). On dating platforms, exercise extra caution before trusting anyone, regardless of how well their profile matches yours.

## 4  Don’t Overshare Your Critical Information 

![A hacker stealing a credit card in an online store.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-hacker-stealing-a-credit-card-in-an-online-store.jpg)

 If you're new to social media, you must [be cautious about what you share online](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-upload-media-to-twitter-without-copying-another-users-tweet/). Never disclose personal information such as your full name, home address, social security number, or financial details. Avoid sharing your travel plans and refrain from revealing your current location while traveling.

 Most importantly, never post photos of your driver's license, credit card, passwords, ID, or other sensitive information that could be easily misused. Keep expensive purchases private to avoid attracting theft attempts. Similarly, avoid sharing details about your work or company that could lead to legal issues. Following these tips will help you avoid unnecessary trouble.

## 5  Follow Safe Browsing Practice 

 To stay safe while browsing the web, [follow safe browsing practices](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-a-bricked-oppo-find-n3-flip-back-to-operation-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/). First, always keep your browser updated and set up any optional security settings. Also, enable the pop-up blocker, avoid clicking on any strange advertisements or pop-ups, ensure the websites you visit are [secured with SSL](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-inspirational-movies-for-momentum-and-self-belief/), and be on the lookout for phishing websites.

 Likewise, avoid downloading anything from untrusted sites, [check download links for malware](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/pinnacle-tools-for-subs-to-srt-unveiling-the-top-8-win-and-mac-software-for-2024/), refrain from using third-party extensions, and don't autofill critical information in the browser. Also, adjust browser settings to manage cookies and avoid clicking on shortened links if you can't be sure where they'll take you.

 Lastly, enable safe search filters to avoid encountering inappropriate content, be wary of malicious search ads, and regularly clear your browsing data.

## 6  Be Skeptical of Unverified Callers 

![A phone with an incoming call and a call forwarding icon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-phone-with-an-incoming-call-and-a-call-forwarding-icon.jpg) 

Lucas Gouveia / Justin Duino / How-To Geek

 Don’t trust any callers from an unverified number asking for critical personal or financial information, especially if they use high-pressure tactics and try to prevent you from ending the call. Always ask the caller for their name, organization, and callback number. Scammers can use fake caller ID information, so be aware of that.

 If there's anything legal involved, ask them to send a claim in writing through official channels. If unsure, hang up or [block the caller](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-strategies-for-perfecting-igtv-video-titles-for-2024/), find the official number (and don't trust a number they provide!), and call them separately.

 Also, be wary of calls from unfamiliar area codes, familiarize yourself with the official contact numbers of companies you deal with, and stay updated on the latest scam alerts from reputable sources like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Trust your instincts—if something feels off, it's wise to be extra cautious.

## 7  Verify News Headlines Before Believing Them

 The internet is flooded with fake and fraudulent news. Don’t let it affect your emotions or push you to take hasty actions. Learn to [recognize the signs to identify such misinformation quickly](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-easy-ways-to-copy-contacts-from-vivo-v29e-to-iphone-14-and-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/). Ensure that the news comes from a reputable source, verify that other established outlets are reporting the same story, and check the date to confirm it's current.

 If there are photos or videos attached, use reverse search tools to confirm they aren't old and see if the article links back to the source. Be wary of sensational headlines and read the entire article to understand the context. Also, check the comment section to see if readers have pointed out inaccuracies.

## 8  Follow Tips for Safe Online Shopping 

![Hands holding credit card and using laptop to shop online.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/8d330f6d.png) 

[Ivan Kruk/Shutterstock.com](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/hands-holding-credit-card-using-laptop-291627674)

 Lastly, you should [take some precautions when shopping online](https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-launching-an-online-fundraising-challenge-on-facebook-for-2024/). Always shop from well-known and trusted retailers, read reviews about the seller to ensure their credibility, make sure the store's website is SSL protected, avoid making purchases when connected to public Wi-Fi, and use a secondary card for online payments.

 Be cautious of deals that seem too good to be true, always check the refund policy before making a purchase, and avoid falling for phishing offers that promise free products. Use secure payment methods, save receipts of order confirmations, buy from verified sellers, factor in shipping costs, and use price comparison tools to ensure you get the best deal.

 Also, fully protect your accounts in shopping apps with secure passwords and [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-premiere-visionary-film-glimpses/), especially if you store your credit card information or bank details there.
