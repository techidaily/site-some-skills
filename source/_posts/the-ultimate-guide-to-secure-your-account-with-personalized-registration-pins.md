 Registration Code  
 Epubor Ultimate for Mac

 Y36MT2H-X66PZ5-GVY6BZ-XYUQJP-UF7JMUZ  
 but every time I try to use the program the license has expired, and now I have retrieved it three times and I'm not able to retrieve any more.  
 Why does my license expire so often?

[Free Trial Activation](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/12/2019 3:42:41 PM 

The website says that there is a 30 day free trial, but the program asks for a registration code. How can I try before buying?

[Can I get a registration code # for my converter software?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/22/2019 6:50:26 AM 

Can I get a registration code # for my converter software so it will work everytime I open it, even offline? Currently, I have to connect to the internet and input my email address for the program to convert the entire file. Otherwise, all it does is convert 3 minutes, as a trial version.

[Am I free??](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/28/2019 1:09:25 PM 

I want to make sure I’m not paying for epubor ultimate. Back in December I signed up for the free trial version (30 days). I do not remember giving my credit card information (though my memory may be playing tricks on me). I expected the program to stop working after 30 days, but it didn’t. Since this happened 8 months ago, I don’t remember the steps I took to install the program. How can I know if Epubor is charging me for using this program? Everything works just fine, which is highly suspicious. Every time I open it, a window asking for my registration code pops up, but I just close it and use the program. Does this window pops up for those of you who have payed for Epubor? Also, the program (in the configurations part) says that I’m licensed to a free trial. I guess it should have my email there if I had paid for this.  
 Maybe I’m being paranoid. Help??

Hello,  
 I downloaded the product as it said it was free, but I'm being asked for a registration code. Where do I get that code?

[My registration code isn't working](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/22/2023 4:31:42 AM

[New test user just downloaded ... was running trial product](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/22/2022 11:37:12 AM 

I ran into a locked up screen situation on your app and had to stop it. I'm on a Mac mini. Now I cannot get back in without a registration code.

 I'd like to know this works before paying $29.99 or whatever it is.

 Also, I reverted back to Kindle 1.31 from 1.35 using your utility but at some point, maybe after reregistering, it became 1.33\. What gives? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!
