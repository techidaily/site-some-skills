In this post I am going to show you how to play YouTube videos on both iOS and Android devices with the screen off or in the background. This is great for listening to podcasts since there's no point in wasting battery on the screen if you're just going to listen to it. More importantly, this is very helpful in multitasking. Using this trick, you'll be able to do your task and listen to youtube in the background at the same time.

### 1\. How to Listen to YouTube on Android with Screen OFF 

Here's the detailed steps for playing YouTube video in background or with the screen off below. Following these steps correctly, you can play youtube video in the background or with screen off. 

1\. You need to download a [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/android/) or [Google Chrome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&hl=en) app on your Android phone. This trick works both for Google Chrome/ Firefox browser.

2\. View [www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com) on Google Chrome browser.

3\. Hit the menu button in Chrome and choose **Request Desktop Site**.

4\. Search for your favorite YouTube video that you want to play in the background and play it. 

5\. Tap the **Homescreen** button when video is playing in the full screen mode. 

6\. Swipe the control center up and tap **Play** button. Then swipe the control center down and continue with your work. 

7\. The video is playing in the background or with the screen off. 

Now you can do task on other browsers or apps while listening to youtube video. 

**Note: Must Choose Request Desktop Site, Or It's Not Going To Work.** 

[Download Google Chrome on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&hl=en)

[Download Firefox on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&hl=en) 

### 2\. How to Listen to YouTube on iOS Device with Screen OFF 

The steps for playing YouTube video on iOS phone or tablet in the background or with the screen off is the same as Android phone. So just repeat the steps above. One cool thing about iOS devices is that you have gotten one more useful browser--[Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/).

### Conlusion

Yes, you do get this option with [YouTube Red](https://www.youtube.com/red), but that comes with a price of $10/month and currently only limited to folks living in the US. But the trick I suggest above is totally free. I mean who doesn't like freebies. If you find this tip is very useful and helpful, do share it with your friends and loved ones.

These steps didn't work for me using chrome. I think its because I'm not sure what you meant by control center. In any case, the video just stops playing when you turn off the screen/lock. (Using chrome in desktop mode, with youtube set to full screen etc.)

It's the swipe down panel at the top of your phone screen, where the time, battery ect is.   
 It shows any music playing in the background - like when Spotify is open. Just press play :)

I'm really sad and frustrated. At first it did work (2 weeks ago) but now it's not. It keeps on opening on video player and not really helping. I'm using Samsung J7.

When I swipe down I don't even see that option. It acts as if you tube isn't playing.
