## Part 1: Why are movie subtitles on the Internet nearly always in .zip format?

You can only extract the srt files from ZIP using any standard quality.

Since you now understand that it's impossible to convert .zip to .srt, the big question is how do you get SRT file out of ZIP? Well, read on to find an answer.
