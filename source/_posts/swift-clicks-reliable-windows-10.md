d) Restart your computer.

 3)**Donâ€™t use USB hubs to connect your mouse** . Directly connect your mouse and keyboard to your computer via the ports at the back of your PC to ensure you get the best performance.

 4) Try to temporarily **disconnect other USB peripherals** , such as a digital camera, USB disk drive, and so on. This will help you confirm whether this problem is caused by device conflicts.

 We hope this helps resolve your problem. If you have any questions, please leave us a comment below.
