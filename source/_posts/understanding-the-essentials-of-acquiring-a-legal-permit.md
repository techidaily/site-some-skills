 Why does my license expire so often?

I bought a lifetime license. I have had several reformats of my system and need a new unlock code. And this probably won't be the last time  
 I am getting ZERO response from tech support. Chats aren't answered, Tickets don't have numbers, emails are never answered.  
 I payed ahead in good faith and would like that good faith to be respected  
 Thanks

[Unable to remove Nook DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/14/2019 8:41:24 AM 

I have downloaded Epubor and trying to remove the DRM from a Nook book that I had recently purchased. I went through the steps on https://www.epubor.com/faq.html#e303 and downloaded/installed Nook Study but was unable to login. I am not sure what I am not doing correctly unless it is that I have to purchase the licensed version of Epubor. If that is the case, I will do so, but I wanted to test it out first to make sure it will remove the Nook DRM.

[Epubor It doesn't work in my Mac with Catalina](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/22/2020 6:47:49 PM 

I have bought Epubor Ultimate for Mac and It doesn't work.I read later that I should buy KCR converter, but on its website it does not clearly state that it does not work in catalina. If i download and install KCR converter, my question is: Can I use the same purchase license? It really works in Catalina? If Epubor Ultimate doesn't work for me, could you return the money to buy the other software??  
 Please I need a solution

[Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 8/3/2020 2:58:43 PM 

I have a license for Epubor Ultimate, but I cannot convert Kindle books anymore. Following the instructions on your website I downloaded KCR converter, and tried my license number for Epubor Ultimate. This did not work, or do I have to buy an additional licens to get Epubor Ultimate working again with the new Kindle content?

[Free trial needs paid license?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/8/2021 3:29:22 AM 

Hello. I just downloaded a free trial for Mac and tested on a Kindle book. It opens with the message: "Please register the software, then get all contents and the valid ebook format."

 Can I register without first paying?  
 If I like the software I would buy the Lifetime License but want to be sure first.  
 Thank you.

[Am I free??](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/28/2019 1:09:25 PM 

I want to make sure I’m not paying for epubor ultimate. Back in December I signed up for the free trial version (30 days). I do not remember giving my credit card information (though my memory may be playing tricks on me). I expected the program to stop working after 30 days, but it didn’t. Since this happened 8 months ago, I don’t remember the steps I took to install the program. How can I know if Epubor is charging me for using this program? Everything works just fine, which is highly suspicious. Every time I open it, a window asking for my registration code pops up, but I just close it and use the program. Does this window pops up for those of you who have payed for Epubor? Also, the program (in the configurations part) says that I’m licensed to a free trial. I guess it should have my email there if I had paid for this.  
 Maybe I’m being paranoid. Help??

[Epubor Cannot Remove Nook DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/23/2019 3:41:13 PM 

The Epubor cannot remove the Nook DRM. The Epubor help tells the user to assure that the Nook user name and password are up to date and refers to a non-existant user setting. Please help. I purchased a lifetime license for the purpose of removing DRM.
