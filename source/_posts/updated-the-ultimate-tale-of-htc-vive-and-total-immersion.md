## 1\. The design of HTC Vive

 There are so many things to discuss about HTC Vive but let us first collect some valuable information about its headset. Developers have designed this headset with highly comfortable material that provides soft touch to user. The memory foam-esque type construction is added to edges so that all skin irritation issues can be avoided even after long hour usage. The Velcro addition further provides easy switching options between materials. Users can definitely enjoy wide and thin fit options with uniquely shaped faces.

### The headset

 You will definitely love its matte black color; people use to say that no VR headset has been designed with such an impressive look till date. It is equipped with sensors at outer portion and they assists in easy connectivity with base stations so that your tracks can stay tuned over entire virtual space. The added head strap serves with quality weight adjustment options so that you do not feel it much heavier on your face. Velcro makes this strap adjustable with a little dial that is attached to one side of headset. All these arrangements make this headset comfortable enough for routine usage and you can definitely enjoy long hour gaming experience without any complaint.

### Controllers

 HTC can manage all signals transferred from headsets while handling two additional handheld controllers. You will find these controls quite similar to those offers by Xbox One with its Oculus Rift but there is no doubt to say that this collection is versatile enough with impressive options to stay connected to the stunning virtual world. These controllers possess trigger options along with well designed touch enabled circular panel whereas a range of physical buttons having build in sensors make virtual space tracking much easier. These advanced sensor units make users enable to establish direct connection with virtual world; this is definitely an outstanding experience for all users and no one can describe it in words.

### Downside of the design

 Although, HTC has added great efforts to make this Virtual Reality module and it serves users with incredible VR experience but still one major drawback is reported by users. The whole arrangement is wired; if it could be wireless then it could be much easier to manage even for beginners. Many users have suffered troubles with this wire based complicated setup arrangement; these wires can even get damaged with little mishandling. HTC is given a try to improve this problem with its added camera arrangement that can be easily toggled on or off. With this high quality camera unit, you can easily observe the physical world while enjoying incredible experience over Virtual Reality.

 HTC has also added heavy duty cable to its design that makes usage much complicated. Especially when you are working with highly interactive games that demand continuous movements then this heavy duty cable can disturb your moves. However, it is well understood that wireless technology is quite expensive and it is little difficult to design light weight VR headsets but it is also difficult to manage movements within limited VR room space. When you are enjoying with a robot in your VR world and suddenly a wire catches you from real world then it will definitely ruin the whole magical experience. The great news is that HTC has recently announced a wires VR headset for near future that can allow gamers to enjoy joyful moves. Further, it is also expected to get a pocket friendly version of VR headsets; hope it will be with us by 2017.

 HTC vive comes with two base stations that offer impressive tracking facilities in a space of 15x15ft. It enables users to have trouble free movements in whole tracking area so that they can enjoy incredible gaming experience with ease.

### Setup

 Once you receive your HTC Vive box then you may have to install few setup specific software tools. They are easily available on official website of vive and you simply need to follow on screen instructions to complete the procedure. The guide will help you to get setup for all components one by one, including controllers, base stations etc. You also need to install special software for your PC and a SteamVR platform is also required along with Steam.

### PC requirement

 HTC Vive demands a powerful PC that can handle its advanced controls with ease. HTC recommends getting this VR module installed over an Intel Core i5 4590 system or any other with equivalent features. Prefer to get a system with 4GB Ram, AMD Radeon R9 290 GPU or NVIDIA GTX970\.

## 4\. How to choose?

 It is definitely difficult to decide. If you have enough budgets then you will definitely find wide range of options in market.

 For PC Gamers: You definitely need a powerful system to run HTC Vive setup otherwise you may face unmatched standard issues.

 For Casual users: There is no doubt that it can offer incredible VR experience but you have to think about price tag as well as required time to time upgrades.

 For first time users: If you have not yet used VR in your life then you will definitely go crazy with HTC Vive but yet you have to mess us with the set up and learn tricks to manage VR room.
