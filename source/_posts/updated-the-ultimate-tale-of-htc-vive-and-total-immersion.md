## 1\. The design of HTC Vive

 There are so many things to discuss about HTC Vive but let us first collect some valuable information about its headset. Developers have designed this headset with highly comfortable material that provides soft touch to user.

### The headset

 You will definitely love its matte black color; people use to say that no VR headset has been designed with such an impressive look till date. It is equipped with sensors at outer portion and they assists in easy connectivity with base stations so that your tracks can stay tuned over entire virtual space. The added head strap serves with quality weight adjustment options so that you do not feel it much heavier on your face. Velcro makes this strap adjustable with a little dial that is attached to one side of headset. All these arrangements make this headset comfortable enough for routine usage and you can definitely enjoy long hour gaming experience without any complaint.

### Controllers

 HTC can manage all signals transferred from headsets while handling two additional handheld controllers. You will find these controls quite similar to those offers by Xbox One with its Oculus Rift but there is no doubt to say that this collection is versatile enough with impressive options to stay connected to the stunning virtual world. These controllers possess trigger options along with well designed touch enabled circular panel whereas a range of physical buttons having build in sensors make virtual space tracking much easier. These advanced sensor units make users enable to establish direct connection with virtual world; this is definitely an outstanding experience for all users and no one can describe it in words.

### Downside of the design

 Although, HTC has added great efforts to make this Virtual Reality module and it serves users with incredible VR experience but still one major drawback is reported by users. The whole arrangement is wired; if it could be wireless then it could be much easier to manage even for beginners. Many users have suffered troubles with this wire based complicated setup arrangement; these wires can even get damaged with little mishandling. HTC is given a try to improve this problem with its added camera arrangement that can be easily toggled on or off. With this high quality camera unit, you can easily observe the physical world while enjoying incredible experience over Virtual Reality.

 HTC has also added heavy duty cable to its design that makes usage much complicated. Especially when you are working with highly interactive games that demand continuous movements then this heavy duty cable can disturb your moves. However, it is well understood that wireless technology is quite expensive and it is little difficult to design light weight VR headsets but it is also difficult to manage movements within limited VR room space. When you are enjoying with a robot in your VR world and suddenly a wire catches you from real world then it will definitely ruin the whole magical experience. The great news is that HTC has recently announced a wires VR headset for near future that can allow gamers to enjoy joyful moves. Further, it is also expected to get a pocket friendly version of VR headsets; hope it will be with us by 2017.
