Since March 2014, all your purchased Sony books might be unavailable from Sony Reader Store anymore, in this situation, removing DRM from Sony books is the most recommended way among all the [methods to protect your purchased Sony books and read them smoothly on Kobo](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/transfer/).

As a supplement of that post, this one is going to focus on how to remove DRM from Sony eBooks within 3 steps.

1Sync the book from Sony Reader for PC/Mac software

Sync purchased books via official reading software for PC/Mac is always recomended for a successful DRM cracking, do does Sony eBooks.

Install the program and login with Sony reader account, then the software will ask you to authorize this software with your Adobe ID and password. Notice, this is the very **important step**! It directly decides if you will be able to remove DRM from those books.

![authorize sony reader with adobe account](http://www.epubor.com/images/authorize-sony-reader-with-adobe-account.png)

After the accounts are settled, on the home page you can see all the book purchased from the Store. The book with an arrow icon on the bottom of the cover means this books is still saved in the server, you need to double click it to start downloading it to your local drive.

![sync sony books via reader for pc](http://www.epubor.com/images/sony-reader-for-pc.jpg)

By default, the books are saved in **"Documents\\My Books\\Reader"**.

2Open the books with Adobe Digital Editions(ADE)

Adobe Digital Editions is the specific program to read Adobe Adept DRMed eBooks, and ADE also provides clues for decrypting the books.

To make sure you can open the books via ADE is to confirm these books can be decrypted successfully.

[Download Adobe Digital Editions - PC/Mac](http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions.html)

Install ADE, and login with the **same Adobe account** which you authorized to Sony reader. This is the premise that you can open the Sony books via ADE.

By confirming you can open synced Sony books via ADE, let's enter the step 3.

I have tried this before and the problem is Adobe doesn't accept my password. I use the same ID and password for my Kobo account. When I try to change my password all I do is go around in circles. Please help!
