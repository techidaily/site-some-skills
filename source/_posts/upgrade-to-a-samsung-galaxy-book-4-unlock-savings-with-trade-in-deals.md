## Upgrade to a Samsung Galaxy Book 4 - Unlock Savings with Trade-In Deals!

Looking to upgrade your Windows laptop? Samsung has trade-in bonuses and more on the new Galaxy Book 4 line of laptops.

 Sometimes, you just need a new laptop. But just because you need to upgrade doesn't mean you need to pay an arm and a leg for it. Samsung has released the Galaxy Book 4 line, and you can trade in your old laptop to save on a model now.

 While trade-in offers are common for smartphones, they're not as common for other devices, and getting rid of outdated laptops isn't always the easiest (though [you can recycle them](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-mastering-sleep-optimal-asmr-experiences-and-picks/)). So being able to trade it in to save some cash is great. With this trade-in offer, you can get up to $800 instantly, and you'll send the old laptop in after getting the Book 4 or replace it.

 But trading in an old laptop isn't the only deal available if you order a Book 4 from Samsung's official store. You'll also get the [Samsung T7 Shield Portable SSD](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Shield-1TB-SSD-Blue/dp/B09VLJB2DC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002274&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Forder-the-samsung-book4-and-save-on-trade-ins-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), which [we gave an Editor's Choice award to](https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-subtitle-editing-on-mac-alternatives-to-subtitle-edit/) and the [best rugged external SSD](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-optimize-logitech-footage-background-free-method/), for free. Finally, you can save $130 on the [Galaxy Buds 2 Pro](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Faudio%2Fheadphones%2Fgalaxy-buds2-pro-graphite-sm-r510nzaaxar%2F), lowering the price to just $99.99.

 All these deals are great, but how does the laptop itself hold up? The standard Book 4 360, which retails at $1,099.00 before all the discounts, comes with a 15.6-inch touchscreen, 8GB of RAM, and an Intel Core 5 processor with integrated graphics. This is very solid for a productivity laptop, but if you need something more powerful, the [Book 4 Ultra](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fgalaxy-books%2Fgalaxy-book4-series%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-book4-ultra-16-intelcore-ultra-7-1tb-moonstone-gray-np960xgl-xg2us%2F) gets you 16GB RAM, an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, and an NVIDIA RTX 4050 or 4070\. The Ultra is more pricey though, at $2,399.99 for the 4050 graphics card, and $2,999.00 for the 4070 GPU.

 These models are just the extreme ends of the models, and the [Book 4 Pro](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fgalaxy-books%2Fgalaxy-book4-series%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-book4-pro-14-intel-core-ultra-7-512gb-moonstone-gray-np940xgk-kg1us%2F) and [Book 4 Pro 360](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fgalaxy-books%2Fgalaxy-book4-series%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-book4-pro-360-16-intel-core-ultra-7-1tb-moonstone-gray-np960qgk-kg1us%2F) offer a middle-ground in terms of specs. With plenty of choices and deals to take advantage of, it's likely you can find yourself a perfect new laptop at a great price.
