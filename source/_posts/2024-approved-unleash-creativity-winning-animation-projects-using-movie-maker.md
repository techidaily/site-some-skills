##### Step1Launch and Add Files in Windows Movie Maker

**Note:** You have the option to upload one file at a time or many files simultaneously.

##### Step2Go to Edit Menu

If you wish to clip off a section, go to "Edit" under "Video Tools" and choose the "Split" option. Depending on where you place the cursor during the section, the software will divide it into two halves. If you want to remove certain snippets, just touch the clip to reveal the context menu and choose "Remove" or "Delete" from the keyboard.
