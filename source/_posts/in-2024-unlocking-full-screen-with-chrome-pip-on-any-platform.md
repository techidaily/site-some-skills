Picture in Picture allows you to watch videos while using other apps on your device. However, you may face challenges while using PIP on your computers. Both hand mobile phones and desktop computers may draw concerns with executing Picture-in-Picture because of different reasons.

### Mobile

If your Picture-in-Picture feature doesn't work even after following all the above steps to the end, there are two methods to fix such difficulties.

2. Enable Picture-in-Picture mode on your device

Here is how to clear the Cache Memory of the YouTube App.

1. Go to **Settings > Apps & Notifications/Application Manager/Installed Apps**
2. In the list of Apps, go to **YouTube > Storage**
3. Tap the **Clear Cache** button then restart your phone

And to enable PIP on your device, follow the steps

1. Go to **Settings > Apps & Notifications** on your phone
2. Tap **Advance > Special App Access > Picture-in-Picture**
3. Tap **YouTube** and toggle **Allow Picture-in-Picture**

Sometimes you may face difficulties when PIP is just disabled on YouTube, so correct this with three simple steps on your YouTube App.

1. Open **YouTube**
2. Go to **Settings > General**
3. Verify if Picture-in-Picture is disabled to enable this PIP feature on your phone.

Another concern comes when PIP is not available in your country. There are two ways to solve this. Using a web browser or VPN. Chrome enables you to use PIP even in countries where it is not enabled.

To enable PIP using Chrome on your Android smartphone, follow the steps below;

1. Open Google Chrome then visit **com**
2. Tap the **3 Dots icon** to enable the Desktop site and allow the page to refresh into a desktop version
3. Play the video in full-screen mode
4. As the video starts to play, tap the **Home button** on your device.
