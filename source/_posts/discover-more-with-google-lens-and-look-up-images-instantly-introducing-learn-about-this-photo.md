## Discover More with Google Lens & Look Up Images Instantly - Introducing 'Learn About This Photo'

Google's About This Image feature is tremendously useful for finding the original source of an image, or at least finding more information about it. Now, Google is expanding the feature and integrating it with some of its more recent additions.

 Google has expanded the "About This Image" tool, [previously only available on Google Search](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/fixing-the-silent-game-solving-roblox-audio-problems-on-windows-11-and-10/), to Circle to Search and Google Lens. This feature helps you understand the context of images you encounter online. "About This Image" provides information on how other sites use the image, any available metadata, and whether or not the image has a Google DeepMind SynthID watermark indicating AI generation. That's not a foolproof check if an image is AI-generated or not, but it's better than nothing.

 About This Image is definitely useful for being able to track down the source of images you come across on Search. Now that it is also expanding to both Circle to Search and Google Lens, you'll be able to come across the source of an image you find in other places as well in just a few clicks or taps.

 To use it with Circle to Search (on compatible Android devices), long-press the home button or navigation bar, circle the image, and swipe up in the search results to find the "About This Image" tab. With Google Lens, screenshot or download the image, open the Google app, tap the Lens icon, select the image, and swipe up to access the feature.

 This tool is available in 40 languages globally and is rolling out on select Android devices for Circle to Search, and the version in Google Lens is coming to Android, iPhone, and iPad devices. If you don't see it yet, and there's not an app update available, you might have to wait a few more days or weeks for the rollout to be complete.
