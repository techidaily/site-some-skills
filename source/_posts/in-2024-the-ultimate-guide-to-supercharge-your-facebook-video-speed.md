But one of the best areas where Filmora excels is giving its users the ability to change speed easily through different methods. You can increase speed, reverse, or create slow-motion effect easily through the timeline icon for Speed or by double-clicking the video clip and choosing Speed Ramping. All the speed changing methods available here are simple to use and get used to on this software.

The three main speed adjustment methods of Filmora include:

**1\. Uniform Speed**

The most usable method to change the speed of the video you add to Filmora is via Uniform Speed. After inserting the file, you can click on it and drag it to the editor timeline. There, right-click on it and choose Unform Speed. You can change the speed range and other options in the window for Uniform Speed.

**2\. Speed Ramping**

For advanced speed adjustment on videos, you can try our Speed Ramping functionality on Filmora. To use it, you can choose the video in the timeline and choose Speed icon > Speed Ramping. Or, right-click the video clip in the timeline and choose Speed Ramping.

**A Step-by-Step Guide to Speed Up a Video on Filmora**

## Conclusion

Facebook does not give the ability to change video speed for users. In this case, it is best to use different external solutions that you can install to make speed changes to the video. Browser extensions are useful for desktop users, while iOS and Android users can try apps.

However, it would be best to use third-party software like Filmora after downloading the video separately for superior-quality video speed changes. There are multiple speed settings, and each one is easy to use.

Try all the methods mentioned in this post and watch the video on Facebook at your preferred speed choice.
