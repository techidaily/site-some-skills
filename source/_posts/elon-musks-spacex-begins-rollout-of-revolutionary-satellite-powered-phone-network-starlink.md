## Elon Musk's SpaceX Begins Rollout of Revolutionary Satellite-Powered Phone Network, Starlink

SpaceX is using its Starlink satellites for more than just internet service. A new page on the Starlink website teases the company's "Direct to Cell" platform, which is now slated to launch in 2024\. It's an interesting proposition—Starlink Direct to Cell is like having a "cellphone tower in space" and works with all existing LTE phones. Other satellite-based phone services require specialized hardware.

 We first heard about Starlink Direct to Cell when it was [announced by Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1562956451538014209) in 2022\. Direct to Cell will be offered as a standalone service, though SpaceX will also grant access to several cellular carriers in key regions around the globe. T-Mobile [will use Starlink](https://media-tips.techidaily.com/1723620208613-discover-the-ultimate-list-of-no-cost-mp3-convertors-for-desktops-laptops-smartphones-and-online-services-ranked/) to reduce dead zones in its U.S. terrestrial coverage, for example. SpaceX is also partnering with carriers in Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Switzerland.

 Interestingly, all of SpaceX's carrier partners will have access to the global Direct to Cell network—this could be hugely beneficial to international travelers. But we're several years away from lightning-fast Direct to Cell service. Connectivity will be limited to "2 to 4 Mbps," according to Musk. And these speeds aren't per-user. Every person in a specified "cell zone" must share the 2 to 4 megabits of bandwidth.

 Because of its slow speeds, Direct to Cell will be limited to text services in 2024\. Improvements in the technology should deliver voice, data, and IOT services a year later. Of course, satellite-based phone service isn't supposed to replace the average person's carrier. It's made to provide better-than-nothing wireless service in remote areas without the need for an expensive tool like the [Garmin inReach Explorer](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/561269). Drastic change will take a long time.

 Note that some new smartphones, including the [iPhone 14 and iPhone 15](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-redefining-cinematic-exploration-via-vr/), contain satellite modems for emergency service. This is also the case for some new smartwatches. Starlink Direct to Cell is special because it doesn't require any special hardware or accessories. It works with all LTE-capable phones, so it should be quite popular among hikers, campers, and those who boat in coastal waters. Direct to Cell isn't totally unique, though: AT&T is [pursuing a similar technology](https://about.att.com/blogs/2023/network-ready.html) and completed the first successful 5G phone call over satellite-based cellular service in September 2023.

 Pricing for Starlink Direct to Cell is unknown, though a price between $10 and $30 a month seems reasonable for satellite service that can only handle text messages (for reference, Garmin's [inReach Safety](http://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/837461/pn/010-06000-SU) satellite membership is just $15 a month). T-Mobile will offer Starlink connectivity for free on its "most popular plans," though some customers must pay an additional fee for satellite coverage. Elon Musk says that Tesla vehicles will gain Direct to Cell service at some point.
