##### Step4Add Transitions

Between two multimedia portions, a transition effect may be added. In the "Animations" section, there are many different transitions available, including dissolves, patterns, and forms. The transition will be included at the start of the chosen medium. You may alter the effect's duration by writing or choosing a new time frame from the dropdown menu next to "Duration."

##### Step5Save the Video

When a transition is applied, a washed-out diagonal zone on the clip in the timeline indicates where the transition starts and finishes. Additionally, you have a choice in the sequence in which the effects are used. This may change how the movie is finally shown depending on the Effects, you choose. Once you're done, click Apply.
