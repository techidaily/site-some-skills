## Unleash Your Creativity: Discover Kling's Revolutionary AI Video Production Technology

Barely a month after its initial release in China, Kaishou Technology's Kling video generation AI is already available globally. There's now a limited free tier and a $5 per month subscription that unlocks more features.

 The new three-tier subscription system promises users "free credits daily" simply by logging in. The platform uses credits as currency with users trading them to generate and manipulate video clips. In addition to daily credits, the system will remove its watermark from finished videos, extend the video length to a full three minutes (free user videos start at five seconds in length), enable advanced video controls and access to Professional Mode. This is a more advanced iteration of the company's current AI model, which promises "to have better instruction following, higher image quality, stronger dynamic consistency," according to the announcement. It's "a significant overall improvement in text-to-video and image-to-video generation compared to the Standard Mode."

 The free tier is not going anywhere. You can still try the video generation software at no cost. Simply go to [klingai.com](https://klingai.com/) and click on the "Sign In" radio button in the top right corner of the home screen, then click the "SIgn up for free" link on the pop-up login menu. The site grants you 66 credits (enough to generate roughly six videos) each day when you log in, regardless of subscription level.

 For the next week (until Monday, August 5 at 11:59am), the company is offering a 50 percent discount on all membership levels. The Standard package, which offers 660 credits per month, is now $60 per year, down from $120\. The 3000 credit-per-month Pro subscription is down to $222 per year ($444 normally) and the Premiere subscription offers 8000 credits per month at a temporarily reduced cost of $552 ($1,104 regularly) each year.

 Kling enters an increasingly crowded marketplace for AI video generation.
