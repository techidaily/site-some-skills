## Revolutionizing Search: Discover How ChatGPT Is Transforming with DuckDuckGo

Everyone is hopping in the generative AI bandwagon these days, including major search engines such as Google and Bing. It's no surprise, then, than others want into the fun. DuckDuckGo has been playing around with generative AI with an AI search feature, but now, it's also adding a chatbot for more general AI processing purposes.

 DuckDuckGo has launched a new AI Chat feature, a free and anonymous way to access popular AI chatbots like OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo and Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku. The company wants to make things different than other AI chatbot makers by putting privacy and anonimiuty at the forefront of everything, which is probably something you'll appreciate if you're concerned about how OpenAI and others are scraping data to train AI. The company emphasizes a thoughtful approach to AI integration, and whenever new features that enhance the search and browsing experience are introduced, the company wants to do so without compromising user privacy.

 DuckDuckGo AI Chat prioritizes user privacy by anonymizing chats and ensuring they are not used for AI model training. The company has agreements with model providers to delete saved chats within 30 days and prohibit their use for training. The tool integrates seamlessly with DuckDuckGo Private Search, allowing you to switch between [traditional search](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-mastery-in-simulating-chrono-displacement/) and AI chat if you happen to need to use AI Chat for research purposes.

 DuckDuckGo is committed to continuous improvement and plans to add more chat models, browser entry points, and a paid plan for higher usage limits and advanced models. For now, the only big limitation we see is the fact that it uses GPT 3.5, whereas Copilot and ChatGPT use GPT 4 Turbo and GPT 4o respectively. Then again, DuckDuckGo is supposed to add more models, so this might be fixed in the future. At the moment, the company is actively seeking user feedback to shape future developments, so if you're interested in giving this a spin, make sure to check it out and give your feedback. ​​​​​​​You can access AI Chat through various channels, including duck.ai, duckduckgo.com/chat, the Chat tab on search results pages, or bang shortcuts (!ai or !chat).
