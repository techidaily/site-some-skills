The last subtitle format we’ll be converting into SRT is the VOB format. Let’s see how to do it.

## How to Convert VOB to SRT

A .vob file extension is a DVD Video Object file that contains video, audio, or even subtitles contents. Most media players can't sort out these types of subtitle files so you must convert them into an SRT file before use.

The best bet for converting a VOB subtitle to SRT is with SONIX.

Here is a stepwise guide on how to convert VOB to SRT.

Step1 First of all, [sign up for the SONIX](https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign%5Fup) for getting free 30 min transcription(charges will be applied after that.)
