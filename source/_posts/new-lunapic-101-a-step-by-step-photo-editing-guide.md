 In photography, the subject in your image should be aligned perfectly so that it can attach the attention of the audience quickly.

This Lunapic crop option can automatically adjust the ratios by making the picture's subject align in the center.

If you are not satisfied with the auto-crop feature, you can manually crop the picture according to your preferences. Thus, auto-crop helps in situations where you don't have extra time to manage the ratios and borders of the frame manually. This is great!
