## Save Big: Get a Whopping 88% Discount on Upgrading to Windows 11 Pro – Act Now!

If you use a Windows PC for work or play but haven't taken a moment to upgrade to Windows 11 Pro, don't miss the chance to do it right now at one of the lowest prices we've seen.

 Are you still stuck on Windows 10 or busy building a new PC for your home office? For a limited time between now and July 21st, How-To Geek readers can get a [Windows 11 Pro license for only $22.97](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-your-apple-id-password-on-your-apple-iphone-13-drfone-by-drfone-ios/), a substantial discount, and 88% off its regular price. Don't pay $200 to upgrade your system when you can get it on sale.

 If you have a PC capable of running Microsoft's latest OS, you may be wondering about the differences between Windows 11 Pro vs. the standard Win 11 Home Edition. As the name suggests, the Pro level [gives you a slew of upgrades](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-elevate-viewer-response-crafting-engaging-ig-story-qandas/). You'll get more features, additional security options, and deeper control over the OS itself.

 Windows 11 Pro is ideal for business professionals, busy home offices, hybrid workers, power users, and more. With it, you can take advantage of all the latest Copilot AI features, remote desktop capabilities, Hyper-V manager access for [virtual machines](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-transfer-text-messages-from-realme-11-proplus-to-iphone-1514131211x8-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/), and higher administrator tools. Another benefit is [Windows Sandbox](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/safeguarding-against-chatbot-breaches-with-insights-into-neural-network-attacks/), which lets you run applications in a virtual environment that's safe and secure away from the rest of your system.

 The [upgrade to Windows 11 Pro](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-a-comprehensive-list-of-8-budget-friendly-srt-services/) also helps you stay safe while opening files, managing or testing new programs, and performing other daily tasks with full BitLocker device encryption beyond what Home Edition offers.

 Finally, this upgrade also unlocks Remote Desktop capabilities, which many users enjoy. That said, even if you don't need some of these fancy features but love the affordable price tag and added security, there's no reason not to upgrade.

 Once you verify that your system can take advantage of Windows 11 and get a license from our link below, you'll get an activation key to install and activate Windows 11 Pro easily. Again, this [massive 88% discount runs until July 21st, 2024](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-your-apple-id-password-on-your-apple-iphone-13-drfone-by-drfone-ios/). Then, you have 30 days to redeem the download code before it expires. Take advantage of this fantastic deal before it's gone.
