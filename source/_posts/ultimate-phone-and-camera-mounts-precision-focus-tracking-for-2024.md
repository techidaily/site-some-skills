### 4\. Zhiyun Smooth 4

This one lives up to its tagline, ‘born for the mobile filmmakers’ owing to its superior features that assist you in creating professional content. Being an extremely efficient, precision and speed-driven auto-tracking camera mount, Zhiyun Smooth 4 is definitely a catch. Especially with the jaw-dropping price that it is offered at.

With this auto-follow camera mount, you can be not only hands-free but also worry-free. Although the bot cannot capture a full circle, the sensitivity of tracking is hard to match.

**Key Features:**

* Focus Pull and Zoom

Smooth 4 operates on an inbuilt handwheel configured into a focus puller that makes the experience so smooth. That combined with the powerful Phone Go Mode, whether its zooming or switching focus, the transition will never disrupt the aesthetics with this auto-follow camera mount.

* Lapses and Slo-Mos

Why limit to time-lapses when you can capture motion-lapse and hyper-lapses as well as detailed slow motions? These lapses are further complemented with the wide-range and triaxial modes to capture unbelievably artistic shots.

**Supported Devices:**

Compatible with all phones and accessories like LED lights and camera lenses.

**Automatic Object Tracking Performance Rating: 4.5/5**
_With 200° tilt and 300° pan object tracking._

With unbeatable features, unreal precision, unprecedented tracking sensitivity, and super attractive price, PivoPod might just be the auto-tracking camera mount you’re looking for.

The automatic tracking feature of this cameraman in the face of a camera mount is equipped with additional intuitive technologies that enable autofocus as well as auto-zoom. So you not only have a bot that follows you around but also one that captures the best shots.

**Key Features:**

* Video Calling and Live Streaming

Pivo saves you the time, energy, and hassle to detach, scroll, and switch. With its multitasking features, you can not just record your moments of movement but also stream them live or on a video call! Present, dance around, or simply enjoy animated actions with auto track on your calls.

* Voice and Gesture Control

Gone are the days you needed to rely on remotes only to forget where you left them. Train your PivoPod (by feeding them voice and gesture data) and simply have it follow your commands anywhere, anytime.

* Remote Control

Too far or busy to control with voice? PivoPod is prepared for every scenario with its remote control option.

**Supported Devices:**

Only compatible with smartphones.

**Automatic Object Tracking Performance Rating: 4.8/5**
_With 360° object tracking._

When on a tight budget, you can compromise a bit on visual flexibility and go for Zhiyun Smooth 4\. For your DSLRs, nothing can beat Crane 2, just like Pivo is an undefeatable frontrunner for mobile phones.
