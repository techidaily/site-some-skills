 The earlier models of Garmin were limited to monochrome screen displays but this time product developers have copied GoPro in impressive manner. VIRB Ultra 30 has been developed with colour LCD screen that can assist users in live preview. The overall dimension of touch screen is 1.75 inch where you can access all photo and video setting icons so easily. But the sad news is that Garmin Ultra 30 is not useful for underwater applications without additional housing. The effective size of Ultra 30 with protective case goes up to 2.3x3.1x1.3 inches whereas overall weight increases up to 5.5 ounces. You can go up to 131 feet under water with this case.
