## Part 3: Hot FAQs on YouTube 4k Converters

Below discussed are the commonly asked questions and their answers related to YouTube 4K converters.

### 1\. What are the supported formats of the video on YouTube?

YouTube supports a wide range of formats for video upload in different file resolutions. Some of the most commonly used formats include MOV, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MP4, AVI, WMV, FLV, 3GP, and more. The entire list can be checked[here](https://support.google.com/youtube/troubleshooter/2888402?hl=en).

### 2\. Is 1080p upscaled to 4K really better?

A 4K video is undoubtedly high in quality and can be used only when some specific content is needed. But on the flip side, there are many issues related to the 4Kresolution like slow video upload speed, high storage, incompatibility with the majority of the device, and similar others.

Thus, considering these in mind, we can say that 1080p is quite a good resolution for your YouTube and other videos, and thus upscaling it to 4K is not a good or a better choice.
