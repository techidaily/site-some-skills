#### **1. GoPro Flat and Curved Mounts**

![ Gopro flat curved mounts ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-flat-curved-mounts.jpg)

These are basic GoPro Mounts, which can be easily mounted to any curved or flat surface so that your action camera is properly mounted at that spot. Ideally, it would help if you bought many of these waterproof adhesive mounts so that you can quickly shift your GoPro Hero from one mount to another. The mounts can be easily detached by applying a heat gun or a hairdryer.

 **Features:**

* The flat and curved adhesive mounts can be attached to any flat or curved surface
* The industrial-strength, waterproof adhesives not just ensures secured mounting but can also be removed by application of heat from a hairdryer or heat gun

* The camera would extend in front of your helmet for self-recording.
* The polycarbonate body makes it extremely durable.
* It is compatible with all GoPro cameras.

#### **3. Helmet Chin Mounts**

![Helmet Chin Mounts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chin-mount.jpg)

The chin mount is going to give the users the best POV angles they would ever get. The chin mount shots would look like they had been filmed from your eyes so that the viewers get the most realistic experience.

#### **4. GoPro Vented Helmet Strap Mount**

![GoPro Vented Helmet Strap Mount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vented-helmet-strap.jpg)

It is more or less like the front mount but makes use of a strap instead of the adhesive. The Velcro strap makes it way easier to mount and dismount your camera. You can even attach it to the strap of your backpack or ever around your leg.

 **Features:**

#### **5. GoPro Side Mount**

![ GoPro Side Mount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/side-mount.jpg)

## Optional Mounts

#### Chest Mount Harness

![ Chest Mount Harness ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-chest-mount.jpg)
