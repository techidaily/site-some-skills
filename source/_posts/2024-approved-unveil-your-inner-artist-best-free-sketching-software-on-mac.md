Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some **free drawing software for Mac** that you can use as a beginner or a professional graphic designer.

Step 3: Use the Text Tool

Click the **Text** tool from the **Markup Toolbar**, drag the text frame to your preferred location on the image, and use the scaling handles to resize the frame.
