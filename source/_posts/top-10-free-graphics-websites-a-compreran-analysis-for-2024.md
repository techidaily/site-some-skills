## Top 10 FREE Graphics Websites: A Compreran Analysis

Do you know how ad agencies create billboards featuring giant soda bottles for their advertisements? Well, they use creative assets known as vector art. Although the term may sound alien to you, it is common within creative circles, especially among professionals who use editing software in post-production.

The following is an overview of what vector art entails and why you should consider it for your next project. In addition, you will also find recommendations for the best free vector art and graphics websites to source for creative assets. Keep reading to discover more.

## Part1: How to Make Good Use of Vector art?

So, what is vector art? Vector art is a creative term to describe images and illustrations you can easily modify without compromising their quality. For example, you can resize vector graphics to fit a billboard print without pixelating the original file. In addition, creating vector art involves using mathematical algorithms to create visual images on software such as Draw and Adobe Illustrator.

Furthermore, vector art results from using geometrical shapes to create images on a coordinate system. Typically, you represent each image point using a pair of numerical coordinates to indicate their distance from two fixed perpendicular lines. In addition, both fixed lines use a similar unit of length to determine the distance. As such, your origin point will always represent by coordinates 0,0.

The following are the common terms that vector art creators use in their work:

* Point

The term refers to an exact location in the creative space. In addition, a point does not have length, width, or thickness dimensions. Instead, you represent it using numerical coordinates on a cartesian plane. For example, coordinates 0,0 represent the origin point on a 2D creative plane.

* Line

A line is a segment of the creative space bound by two endpoints. In addition, you can represent it as a closed line segment where you indicate both endpoints or an open line segment that excludes the endpoints.

* Curves

Conversely, curves are non-straight segments of your creative space. In addition, you use them to trace moving points in your creative space. For example, creators use parabolas to represent curves in their vector art.

* Polygons

These images on your creative space have a specific number of connecting endpoints. For example, a triangle is a polygon with three connecting endpoints. In addition, you can create self-intersecting polygons where the image boundary crosses over itself. Star polygons are the most common example of self-intersecting polygons.

Vector art is best for creative works in the following categories:

* Album Covers.
* Movie Posters.
* Video Games.
* Printed Ads.
* Branded merchandise that features your logo.

## Part2: Best Free vectors websites recommendations

Now that you know what vector art entails, here is a list of the best free vector websites you should check out. Furthermore, the free vector websites in this list cover the types of vectors you can use for different projects, including icons, images, clipart, and graphics.

## Part3: FAQ

### What are the most common vector file extensions?

You can download vector files in the following formats, AI, EPS, SVG, FH, CDR, PDF, and EMF. However, the final output depends on the editing software you use. For example, your EPS and PDF files can also be raster files.

### What is a raster file?

Raster files are bitmap images that you cannot alter according to size or scale. This is because they consist of pixels that are harder to edit than vector graphics. As such, you should always consider vector files if you require larger images without sacrificing the quality.
