The built-in **free drawing software for Mac**, Preview, has some markup tools that allow you to annotate and draw shapes on the images. The step-by-step instructions are given below explain how this can be done with the least effort:

Step 1: Reveal Markup Toolbar

Right-click the photo you want to edit on Mac, go to **Open With**, and click **Preview (default)**. Next, click the **Show Markup Toolbar** from the upper-right corner of the interface to get the **Markup Toolbar** under the standard toolbar.

Step 2: Use the Shapes Tool

Click the **Shapes** icon in the **Markup Toolbar**, and select your preferred shape tool from the available options. Drag the automatically added shape to reposition it to your preferred location on the image. Optionally, use the scaling handles to resize the body as needed. Next, click the **Border Color** and **Fill Color** icons and select your preferred colors for the shape’s outline and background color.

Step 3: Use the Text Tool

Click the **Text** tool from the **Markup Toolbar**, drag the text frame to your preferred location on the image, and use the scaling handles to resize the frame. Next, click inside the frame, delete the placeholder text, and type a new caption instead. Now, click the **Text Style** icon, and use the available options to format the text as needed.

**Summary**

There are several **free drawing software for Mac**. Depending on your needs, the complexity of your work, and the type of tools you need in the application, your definition of the **best free drawing software for mac** may vary from that of your friends or colleagues.
