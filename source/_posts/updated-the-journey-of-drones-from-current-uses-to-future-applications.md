 Applications of Drones are not limited to the military world only rather they are serving a big part of economy with advanced mechanisms and impressive capabilities. The growing interests of users in the drone technology have developed new fields of application for it. Presently, drones are working in so many areas and with continuous advancements in technologies these machines are going to be more robust and useful in coming future too. They are now able to carry huge payloads and can serve users with longer flight times as compared to their older versions. With growing technology, many new sensors are being added to drones so that their operation can be highly optimized and they can work for dedicated applications with high performance.

 Drones are now working in all fields where humanity uses to operate; you can find them in agriculture industry as well as in the world of internet. Here we are going to talk about 9 most wonderful applications of Drones that can help you to know about their impressive capabilities.

## Drone/UAV Applications at Present and in the Future

#### 1\.  Drone finds its application in Aerial Photography

 One most common use of advanced camera carrying drone units is to capture media coverage from inaccessible locations. Earlier, only big news industries were able to capture critical shots due as they were able to afford helicopters. But today almost all small scale media houses and local journalists are able to capture crystal clear air footage for impressive news coverage/. Drones can also move easily to tighter areas due to their small size so they care also utilized for recording face to face interviews.

#### 2\.  Can be implemented for search and rescue operations

![drones in delivery](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drones-in-delivery.jpg)

 Drones these days are equipped with thermal sensors so they are able to locate the position of lost persons. They are also able to work in dark and inside a challenging terrain. The search and rescue operations were suffering a lot from long time due to lack of technology but now drones can make everything possible within few minutes. They can be used for deployment as well as for search and rescue missions at critical battle times. They are capable enough to drop supplies at unreachable locations.

#### 3\.  In the field of agriculture

![drones in engineering

 This is the biggest achievement of drone technology as they are now able to serve farmers for many purposes. Drone can help farmers to save their money as well as crops by keeping an eye of failing plants. They can study the large sized farm lands along with proper monitoring of irrigation systems. Farmers can now hope for all information updates quickly and drones can also help them to spray fertilizers, pesticides and water for crops at right times.

#### 4\.  Drone for shipping and delivery
