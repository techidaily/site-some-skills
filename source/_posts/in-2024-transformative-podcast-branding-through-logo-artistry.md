## Part 1\. What Is a Podcast Logo?

Before we get into how great podcast logos are made, let's look at the basics of a podcast logo. It's important not to get podcast logos mixed up with podcast artwork. Podcast artwork can warry for episodes or series and represents them individually.

## Part 4\. 5 Useful Tips for Creating Knock-Out Podcast Logos

Now that we've learned about the best logo-creating platforms, let's go over some of the things you should consider to make the best possible logo for your podcast.

### 1\. Think about where your logo will be used

The most crucial aspect of your logo is its image size and quality. Your logo will be used in various places, so you need to have a set of different sizes. Your logo will only be helpful if visible, so you must ensure that you use a high enough image quality.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901369&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg" border="0"> vMix 4K - Software based live production. vMix 4K includes everything in vMix HD plus 4K support, PTZ control, External/Fullscreen output, 4 Virtual Outputs, 1 Replay, 4 vMix Call, and 2 Recorders.

### 2\. Don’t be afraid to use color

The logo's color will stir up emotions in your audience and help set the mood for your podcast. Using bright and vivid colors is the best way to capture your audience. It's vital to keep the shade constant; otherwise, you'll end up with mismatched colors.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Avoid overused icons

Icons are a fundamental part of any logo but using bland overused icons will not let you stand out in front of other podcast creators. It's best to use unique icons that viewers are attracted to and intrigued by.

### 4\. Dont be too literal

Never limit the kind of logo you can use. Let your creativity be a region with no boundaries. Only when you let your imagination run wild will you be able to create a great logo. You should also not be afraid of simplicity. Often the simplest ideas go the longest way.
