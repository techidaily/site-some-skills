##  Alacritty

![alacritty Linux terminal on Ubuntu](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/alacritty-linux-terminal-on-ubuntu.png)

[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is fast, lightweight, and has an easy-to-edit configuration file with extensive customization options. It is a [GPU-accelerated](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-list-of-premium-androidpc-video-editors/) terminal emulator that balances features and simplicity perfectly. Some of Alacritty's features include font size adjustment, cursor setting, clickable links, Vi mode, multi-window, and copy/paste right from the start.

 Additionally, you can personalize Alacritty using its configuration file. Its configuration is based on YAML files that allow you to customize various settings such as window title, startup mode, window dimensions, and cursor styles.

 For example, you can set the opacity property in the window section of your config file to a value between 0.0 (transparent) and 1.0 (opaque). You can also customize your font in the font section by choosing the family, style (regular, bold, italic), and size.

 Built with Rust, Alacritty supports Linux, macOS, and Windows. If you are using Linux, then you can install it from your distro's default repositories.

 To install Alacritty on Ubuntu or Debian, run:

sudo apt install alacritty

 On Arch Linux, use this:

sudo pacman -S alacritty

 Use DNF to install Alacritty on Fedora or RHEL:

sudo dnf install alacritty

##  Kitty

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
[Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) also uses the GPU for rendering, just like Alacritty. Using OpenGL and GPU acceleration ensures smooth rendering even when dealing with large amounts of program output.

 With Kitty, you can open new tabs and windows, switch between them, and customize the layout. It includes advanced features like true color, mouse support, focus tracking, hyperlinks, and image display.

 You can also modify the configuration file to customize settings based on your preferences. For example, you can change the font size or color or configure features like scrollback lines, the tab bar's location, and terminal opacity.

 To install Kitty on Ubuntu and other Debian-based distros, run this command:

sudo apt install kitty

 On Arch Linux, use Pacman:

sudo pacman -S kitty

 On Fedora or RHEL, use:

sudo dnf install kitty

 One standout feature of Kitty is its [kittens](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens%5Fintro/)—scriptable terminal programs. For example, the icat kitten allows you to view images directly in the terminal. To display the image in a terminal, run:

kitty icat <path-to-image>

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
[Terminator](https://gnome-terminator.org/) sets itself apart from your default terminal by providing the ability to split your screen horizontally and vertically within a single window. This feature is particularly useful for multitasking, comparing command outputs, and running multiple services simultaneously without switching between terminals.

 You can also assign custom titles to each terminal window, making it easy to identify and switch between them. Additionally, you can reorder terminals via drag and drop, share them as profiles, and customize layouts, color schemes, fonts, and set keyboard shortcuts.

 To install Terminator on Ubuntu or Debian-based distros, run:

sudo apt install terminator

 To get Terminator on Arch Linux, run:

sudo pacman -S terminator

 For CentOS/RHEL or Fedora, use this:

sudo dnf install terminator

[Guake](https://github.com/Guake/guake) is a lightweight terminal emulator designed specifically for [the GNOME desktop environment](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-complete-vivacut-overview-editors-deep-dive/). It takes inspiration from the Quake game console, sliding down from the top of your screen when you need it and disappearing just as quickly.

 Guake pops up with a single hotkey (default: F12) and vanishes just as easily, keeping your workflow uninterrupted. You can personalize Guake's appearance with various color schemes and transparency levels. Guake seamlessly works across multiple monitors, ensuring you have a terminal wherever you need it.

 Guake is available on all major Linux distributions through their official repositories. To install it on Ubuntu or Debian-based distros, run:
