## Part 1: Method 1: Use a voice changer app on your phone

For mobile applications, I can say that VoiceFX is the best one as a voice changer for PUBG. It offers users to change their faces in real-time. VoiceFX also enables you to do a live stream with a changed voice. What is even better is the application is completely free. If you prefer using your phone, I recommend you use this application.

For your information, VoiceFX is a voice changer and voice recorder application with audio effects. It also enables you to live playback your voice with voice effects and hear people talking live with a transformed voice. The available voice changer's audio effects are Female, Male, Kid, Chipmunk, Alien, Sheep, Autotune, Double, Robot, Space, Strong, Mask, Drunk, Slow, Fast, Monster, Cave, and many more.

Here are some good features of this VoiceFX application, such as applying audio effects for recording and changing voice, saving, sharing, setting as phone ringtone, load music or other audio files to apply voice changer effects on music or other audio files by loading them, playback your microphone and change voice live and change voice live and live stream your microphone to media players or web browsers.

You can use this application to prank your friends and you can even pretend to be a bot. Whatever your intention, you can use this application as **a voice changer for PUBG mobile**. Now you may wonder how you use VoiceFX for PUBG, here are the steps to use VoiceFX:

Step1 Download and open VoiceFX

![navigate to the setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-3.jpg)

Download VoiceFx, then open the application. Navigate to the setting.

![choose the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-5.jpg)

Choose any sound effect that you want and open PUBG on your mobile. Then you are ready to play Voice FX in the game.

## Part 2: Method 2: Use a voice changer app on a PC

Are you prefer using a PC when playing PUBG? Surely, playing PUBG on your mobile is fun and it is also more simple, but there is a limit that you can't do on your mobile. When you are gaming, the flexibility of the keyboard and mouse are the best things ever. Then, can you play PUBG mobile on your PC or laptop?

In this part, I will let you know how you play PUBG on a PC and how to connect with a PC voice changer. Tencent just launched its official PUBG Mobile emulator which enables you to play it even on a PC or a laptop. For those who want to have flexibility without limitation, you better watch the steps on how you play PUBG mobile on your PC below:

Step1 Download and install the Tencent Gaming Buddy emulator

![click download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-6.jpg)

Download Tencent Buddy Emulator, then run the software and it will download the required files automatically. It takes about 10-15 minutes to install it.

Step2 Download the additional files

![download additional files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-7.jpg)

When the emulator is installed, launch the game. It will download some necessary files required to launch the game. Make sure you have good internet connectivity since these files are large.

Step3 Get your chicken dinner

![you are done](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-8.jpg)

When finish downloading all the additional files, log in with your credentials to import all your mobile PUBG stats. All the controls are in a tab towards the right side of the screen, enter full-screen mode by pressing F11\. Since PUBG servers detect emulators, you and your friends will only be paired with other players running this emulator.

Then, you may ask, “How do I connect with a PC voice changer?” No worries, I will let you know too. For your information, free voice changers are much easier to find on PC. There are some good voice changers for PUBG such as Clownfish, Voicemod, and MorphVOX. I will give you the steps to connect with Clownfish in PUBG:

Step1 Download and launch Clownfish

![set voice changer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-9.jpg)

Download the software, then launch it. After that select “Set Voice Changer” and select any desired sound effects.

Step2 Click on “Hear Microphone”

![hear the voice effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-10.jpg)

Click on “Hear Microphone” and hear the voice effects. Turn that off when you have chosen your favorite effect and you are done.

## Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone

After you know the voice changer on your phone and your PC for PUBG, what is another alternative you can do to change your voice in PUBG? Well, eventually you can also use a hardware voice changer and connect it to your phone. When you use hardware, the result should be in real-time, which is less than a 30ms delay, while it takes a longer delay when you use the software.

There are some hardware voice changers out there. For the hardware, I recommend you try TC Helicon VoiceLive Play. The TC Helicon VoiceLive Play is such a great vocal effects unit. It is simple, has a user-friendly layout, and has a small footprint. Around the LCD Display, there are six buttons. They are labeled and work dependent on context when you're in the menus on the VoiceLive Play.

Their base functions are Genre, Setup, Effects, Favorite, Practice, and Mix (to adjust the output levels, USB input level, and the level for the in-built mic). These controls have context-dependent functions. To navigate the menus and adjust selected parameters, just simply use the left-right arrow buttons and the control dial below. There are also Back and Store buttons on either side of these. You use these to step back a menu level and save any changes that you've made.

![voicelive play](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-11.jpg)

Compared to the VoiceLive 3 and the VoiceLive 3 Extreme's menus, the 32-page guide to the VoiceLive Play tells you that the pedal is so simple to get to grips with. The menu system and layout of the VoiceLive Play make it easy to access any features that you want. There is a feature that will give you the tools you need to produce pretty much any vocal effect you want.

The effects groups include harmonies, reverbs, delays, transducers HardTune, doubling, harmony effects, and μmod, which is TC Helicon's name for chorus, flangers, and similar effects. The sounds are generally good, too. For the price, the TC Helicon VoiceLive costs $ 279\. Overall, once you finish setting up gotten your sounds, it's really easy to incorporate the VoiceLive and you can have a hardware voice changer for PUBG.

## Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?

Besides those mentioned above, do you know that you can also edit the video with Filmora? For your information, Filmora is a video editing and creation application that was developed by Wondershare. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) offers products for a range of users from beginners to intermediates. There are some features like a preview window, effects library, and a timeline, and navigated and controlled using a drag-and-drop interface.
