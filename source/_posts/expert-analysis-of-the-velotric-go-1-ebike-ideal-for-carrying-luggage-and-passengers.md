##  Velotric Go 1 Design and Style

 Let’s just say style is not the strong suit of the Velotric Go 1\. The company’s other ebikes have some sense of fashion to them, so the utilitarian look of the Go 1 is no accident. Instead of being concerned with vanity, this new bike is focused on function and purpose. I never felt cool riding the Go 1, but I also didn’t have time to care because when I was riding it, I was on a mission—usually taking one of my kids somewhere.

 One aspect of the design I did love was the lower, step-through bar. Where that high or low bar was once a sign of a bike for males or females, it has now mostly become a feature of accessibility—that’s great.

 The Go 1 puts the throttle and control buttons on the left side of the handlebars and the gear shifter on the right side. The placement of the throttle didn’t annoy me quite enough to change it to the right side, but it came close. It felt odd on the left instead of the right. I did, however, appreciate that the throttle was a push lever instead of a twist one that was part of the hand grip.

![Showing a close up of the dual-sided kick stand](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/c4ab32e5-97b2-4863-a432-21ea6912ac88.JPG)

 Another oddity was the underneath, dual-sided kickstand. To engage it, you step on the kickstand, roll the bike back, and then reverse to disengage it. It’s a more stable option for a bike that could have a lot of gear attached to it. It worked fine. In general, using the slightly unique kickstand wasn’t a pro or a con, simply an exercise in overcoming familiarity.

##  Speed and Range of a Cargo Ebike

![Showing the display of the Velotric Go 1](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/829c16d4-8abf-49da-bb9a-c92a90558c68.JPG) 

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 I’ve used multiple ebikes from Velotric over the past year, and each has provided a reliable range. The same was true for the Go 1\. This one is rated for 48 to 55 miles of range. Of course, mashing the throttle on the highest power will keep optimal range estimates at bay, but even still, I was able to go a couple of weeks in between charges. Usually, I rode for 3 to 4 miles at a time and every other day or couple of days. The battery is removable, which is a worthy feature for people who can't charge their bike where they park it.

 The Go 1 is a class 2 ebike, meaning it has a top speed of 20 miles per hour using the throttle. However, the bike can be unlocked using a series of codes on the display to achieve a top speed of 25MPH. While 20MPH was fine, the little bit of extra oomph really helped make the riding more enjoyable over most terrain.

 I really didn’t care for the Go 1’s throttle being connected to the level of pedal assist. If I was using the lowest level of pedal assist, for example, then pressing the throttle would only result in achieving 8MPH, or whatever the top speed for level 1 was. Essentially this meant I needed to live in the highest pedal assist level so that the throttle would have the most power available.

 I’ve used other ebikes where those two areas are separate—the throttle always provided full power while the power assist level was dedicated to pedaling speed. This method of power delivery isn't enough of a deterrent to not recommend the bike. There are reasons why people might like this method. I just didn’t care for it.

 This cargo bike can handle a total load of 440lbs, including the rider. I didn’t have the optional add-on front and rear baskets to test this fully, but I did, separately, take my son, daughter, and wife all on rides, and the bike had no problem with the weight.

##  Tracking the Go 1 with Apple’s Find My

 Velotric lists the integrated inclusion of Apple’s [Find My](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-the-creators-guide-to-the-top-9-affordable-video-editing-apps/) tracking as a security feature of the Go 1\. I thought it was convenient to see where the bike was, using the same Find My app where I track my AirPods and AirTag devices, but I don’t know if it should be in the same class as theft prevention.

 Having Apple’s tracking tech integrated directly into the ebike saves you $29 from having to buy an AirTag and manually attach it. But really that’s all that the feature is. The bike connects to an Apple device in the same way an AirTag does. It also functions in the same way, for better or worse. In other words, it doesn’t provide real-time GPS tracking, but more of a periodic check-in of where it’s at, or where it's been.

 There's no app for the Go 1, so I liked that Find My compatibility was built-in, and it worked well. But I wouldn’t buy this bike solely because of this feature.

##  Velotric Go 1: Price and Availability

 The Velotric Go 1 is available now for a retail price of $1,799\. Currently, the bike is on sale for $1,599\. The Go 1 comes in either green or gray colors.

##  Using the Velotric Go 1 with Kids

![Showing the added padded seat to the rear of the Velotric Go 1](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/4330cd5b-5a29-4fbc-a2c2-2ded5144ab69.JPG)

 The padded seat, foot pegs, and rear handlebars add-on costs total just north of $150\. Another 10% to the bike’s price isn’t crazy, but it does present another consideration.

 I used these three accessories with the Go 1, which were all essential for when my 12-year-old or 10-year-old rode with me. Their feet needed a place to rest. Holding onto my waist was inconvenient. The padded cushion was also invaluable to prolonged comfort. (The [rear handlebars](https://www.velotricbike.com/products/velotric-packer-1-go-1-passenger-handrail?variant=41867838816439) are not pictured because they arrived later and separate from the bike.)

 I used the bike multiple times to take one of my kids to an appointment a few miles away. They had no problem holding on and riding at the 20 to 25 miles per hour speed. In fact, they loved it. Most of the time, I found the Go 1 more convenient to use [instead of a car too](https://www.reviewgeek.com/112628/are-electric-bikes-practical/).

 I didn’t have the front basket, but adding that accessory would also help to carry more than just a child. Whenever I used the bike with one of my kids, one of us would often need to wear a backpack to carry a water bottle or other items.

 If you want to ride with multiple kids at once, Velotric also has the larger [Packer 1 ebike](https://www.velotricbike.com/products/velotric-packer-1-e-bike?variant=41850584039607). It's similar to the Go 1, but a step up in the amount of cargo it can carry.

##  Should You Buy the Velotric Go 1?

![Showing the Velotric Go 1 standing in front of a body of water](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/f1bbe908-bd02-4046-a136-f732e0a8ec7f.JPG)

 I’ve had great luck with multiple Velotric bikes. In a sea of generic ebike options, Velotric tries to set itself apart by putting in some of the design work instead of only using commodity items. I have been impressed with the quality over time. It’s a small piece of how its bikes can generally be a solid value in comparison to competitors.

 In terms of the [Go 1](https://www.velotricbike.com/products/velotric-go-1-e-bike?variant=41850583482551) specifically, it’s a utility ebike. If your objective is to be able to haul something on two wheels, then it’s a great choice. I loved transporting my kids via bike instead of always having to use a car. It had enough range to traverse a meaningful distance. It also had enough power and speed to always feel peppy.

 While I thought the Go 1 was a smooth and easy bike to ride, it’s not my default recommendation for anyone looking for a new ebike. It’s not made for off-roading and rough terrain as much as other options are. It’s also less stylish and design-focused than even the [Velotric Discover 1](https://www.reviewgeek.com/121536/velotric-discover-1-e-bike-review-an-affordable-comfortable-cruiser/) is. The Go 1 is a great choice for parents moving kids and couriers transporting items because of its minimal footprint, high load capacity, and general versatility.
