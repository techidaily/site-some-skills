### 1\. Windows 10 built-in speech to text service

![in speech to text service](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-google-docs-5.jpg)

Voice typing is available for Windows 10 users as a default feature. As such, you do not need to download anything additional to use the service. In addition, it allows you to transcribe your audio across all the operating system's apps and programs.
