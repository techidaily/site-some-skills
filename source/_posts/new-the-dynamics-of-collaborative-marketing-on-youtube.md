### Never Reach out brand that you don’t believe in

Collaborating with the brand you don’t like is a wrong decision. Don’t always think about the money and the free product, but think about how you can do your job well without faking your reaction.

Every video you post need to bring value to your viewers. You might really want to create branded content and build a partnership, but if the content you produce doesn’t line up with your brand, your audience won’t care about it and even your channel and the brand will suffer at the end.
