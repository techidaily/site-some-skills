## Part 1\. Pros and Cons of Telegram Marketing

Firstly, let's look into why we should seize the opportunities to develop marketing on Telegram. Following are the pros of Telegram marketing:

* Cost-effective way to reach a wide audience. This will be presented in the Part 2 and Part 3 of this article.
* Increased user engagement as the there are more and more active users on T
* Improved traffic on the website resulting in increased conversions.
* More brand exposure due to highly active Telegram groups.

Besides, apart from the benefits Telegram Marketing can bring to you, we also list a few cons of it as follows:

* **Telegram Is Not a Public Platform**: This means your messages will be private as intended. However, it also means that you will have to build your network of followers interested in what you have to say before reaching out to them with marketing messages.
* **Difficult Access to a Wider Audience:** Telegram is mainly used by cryptocurrency enthusiasts and those already familiar with blockchain technology. As such, it will be difficult for you to reach out to those people who have not heard about blockchain or crypts yet.
* **Less Engagement**: Another disadvantage of Telegram marketing is less engagement compared to other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. It can be challenging to hunt for people who want to follow your brand on Telegram. Also, it won't be easy to keep them engaged in your community after finding them.
* **The Inability to Track User Activity:** There are no analytics tools available on Telegram. For example, you can't use Google Analytics or other similar tools to track engagement and conversions to understand your target audience and establish what works for them.
* **No Public Visibility for Your Brand:** No public platform means no public visibility for your brand or product. You can expect only those people to see your marketing content already using the Telegram platform and have added you as a friend.

As a result, brands are turning to Telegram media channels to create more engaging customer experiences. And there are various ways for you to create marketing opportunities on Telegram.

### 1\. Joining Other Groups

For a cost-effective way to market your business campaign on Telegram, try joining other groups related to your industry. Search these groups directly or click on links shared in different groups.

It's essential to follow the rules of the groups you're joining. For example, if a group doesn't allow commercial posts or self-promotion, don't post about them. Failing to follow the rules of other groups can result in banishment.

### 2\. Telegram Ads

Placing advertisements on Telegram communities and utilizing different bots is one of the most well-liked methods of online business promotion.

There are some of its benefits:

Attracting Traffic

Telegram ads can be used to bring new visitors to your website or landing page that can help you grow your business.

Your Budget Can Be Easily Balanced

Your ads will be targeted to people who are interested in them so that you won't waste money on irrelevant clicks and impressions.

Customer Engagement

With Telegram Ads, customers can respond directly through chat, so it's easier to communicate with them and receive feedback about your products/services to improve your marketing strategy based on their needs.

Building Your Community

Telegram ads are a great way to build your community by sharing news, updates, exclusive offers, discounts, and more. Considering this method with the cons listed above and thinking how can you use it to promote your Telegram business.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Cross-Promotion

Cross-promotion is a deal between the admins of two Telegram channels to promote each other by swapping their links. So, they can get people from other channels to join and grow their followers.

If you want to take this route, here are a few pieces of advice to consider:

* Mostly, big channels won't accept your request. So, try to contact admins whose groups have a small to medium members/followers list.
* Once you've created all your groups, start cross-promoting them by sending out @ mentions in other groups.
* Use your combined mailing lists to send out a promotional postcard together.
* Hold a contest where all your partners contribute prizes.

### 4\. Using Your Business's Websites

Add your Telegram link to your website. Make sure it's easy to find by adding it to the top of every page. This will help you get more followers and increase awareness of your brand.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5\. Influencer Marketing by Influencers

Influencer marketing is a powerful Telegram marketing strategy for your target audience in which you take the help of influential people to promote your products and services.

These influencers are often bloggers, journalists, and personalities with large followings on social media. However, this strategy will cost you as the influencers can charge a lot to promote your products or services to their following.
