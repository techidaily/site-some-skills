##  Where to Install Tesla's Wall Connector Charger?

[Tesla](https://shop.tesla.com/product/universal-wall-connector)

 Tesla's Wall Connector Chargers, or the [newest Universal Charger](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/still-using-pattern-locks-with-infinix-smart-7-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/), are all designed for a quick and easy installation. Each unit has integrated terminals, long charging cables, and Wi-Fi for ease of use. Keep in mind that [Tesla recommends](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging/wall-connector/installing) all chargers be installed at your home or commercial business by a certified professional. Tesla even has a [tool to help owners find a certified installer](https://www.tesla.com/support/certified-installers?productType=homecharging) in their area.

 Electric car charging stations are high-voltage electrical systems that require professional installation. Plus, a certified installer will ensure voltage and panel compatibility and help find an ideal location for the charging station.

 Where you install a Tesla Wall Connector depends on your specific situation. Not every home has the same driveway, garage, or ideal placement. Furthermore, some homeowners may have a detached garage that's not easily accessible or used for parking vehicles, let alone a garage at all. And while Tesla does recommend installing the charger indoors, not to mention it's best to charge an EV indoors and away from elements and [temperature shifts](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-how-to-use-luts-in-premiere-pro/), that doesn't mean it's your only option.

 Considering you're plugging huge wires full of electricity into a massive battery pack, it's fair to wonder whether home chargers can be installed outdoors. Even though almost every public charger is outdoors and all of Tesla's website images show its Wall Connectors outside, it's still a common question. And yes, you can install Tesla's home chargers (and most other brand options) outdoors without worry.

 Tesla's Wall Connector home EV chargers are fully weatherproof, have sealed designs, hide any installation wires inside the wall, and even come with long 12, 18, or even 24-foot cables. As a result, installation on the outside of a garage or the front of a home near the driveway is perfectly acceptable.

 Additionally, some owners with a garage but don't use it for parking still install EV chargers inside, especially if the cable is long enough to reach a vehicle. That way, it's inside and away from the elements, but the 18-ft cable can still reach a vehicle for charging through the garage door or custom-designed holes in the wall for cable routing. This gives you more flexibility for charger placement and parking.

 As long as you follow the proper protocol for outdoor electrical installations (or hire a professional certified installer), you can absolutely install a Tesla charger outdoors. Furthermore, speeds will not be affected by choosing an outdoor install, yet you'll have it conveniently located for your situation.

[Tesla](https://shop.tesla.com/product/universal-wall-connector) 

 While Tesla already offers a selection of home and business EV chargers, the latest model is a [Universal Wall Connector that works with any EV](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/still-using-pattern-locks-with-infinix-smart-7-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/). It has Tesla's standard plug, which will soon double as the North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug type, along with an integrated [J1772](https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/1721202660702-stellar-file-eraser-5-windows-standard-en-setting-scheduler-for/) adapter for other brand EVs. Here's what to expect for those interested.

* Up to 44 mi of range added per hour at 11.5 kW / 48 amp output
* Integrated J1772 adapter to conveniently charge any electric vehicle
* Auto-sensing handle to open a Tesla charge port
* Monitor and manage your charging schedule and usage from the Tesla app
* Wi-Fi connectivity for over-the-air updates, remote diagnostics, and access controls
* Versatile indoor/outdoor design
* Variable amperage configurations depending on installation location
* Power-share with up to six Wall Connectors
* 24-foot cable length
* Four-year warranty for residential use

 As you can see from the specifications listed above, the Universal Wall connector has a versatile indoor/outdoor design. Remember that while Tesla's home chargers are between $475 and $600, that's only for the charger itself. Most buyers will need to hire a professional installer whose job may include rewiring electric panels, upgrading a 120V outlet to 240V, and more, all of which will increase costs.

 Either way, once you install a charger at home, you can [save money on charging](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/grau-gmbhs-video-restoration-suite-comprehensive-hardware-and-software-fixes/) while skipping the gas station and avoid those over-used and busy EV chargers throughout the city.
