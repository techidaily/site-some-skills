## The Essential Checklist for Using Zoom on Your Windows PC

The need for technology for remote conferencing has never been greater as more individuals across numerous industries begin working from home. While physical offices are closed, services like Zoom for win10, which provide online meetings and video conversations, are more important than ever for keeping organizations operating effectively. Although the Zoom win 7 platform is pretty simple to use, depending on whether you use the desktop or mobile version, its core features are set up significantly differently for Zoom win 10\. Find the details in the upc0oming sections to learn about Zoom for win10.

The increasing demand of Zoom in Windows 7 has resultantly enforced users to use Zoom win 10 on their new window versions. Fortunately, installing Zoom on your PC is a quick and easy procedure that will have you using the service in no time. One of the most popular video conferencing systems is now Zoom. You may have noticed that you didn't have to register to attend if you've ever attended a Zoom win 7 meeting. Zoom requires that you create a free account and as soon as Zoom for win10 has been installed on your computer, you may start using it right away. Here are the details.

## Part 1\. How to Download Zoom Desktop Client

A popular trend, particularly in the last two years, is working from home. Although the Basic plan that is free has a 40-minute time restriction on group meetings, Zoom is accessible for download for free. However, you are permitted to hold an infinite number of one-on-one meetings and group meetings with up to 100 participants. If you want more, you may upgrade to the Pro plan, which raises the 24-hour meeting time limit and adds admin controls and features like a personalized meeting ID and user management.

**Steps to Download Zoom Desktop Client:**

As we are all aware, Zoom allows us to host meetings, attend lectures, and see webinars. As opposed to conventional offices and schools, Zoom also makes it feasible and simpler to capture a screen during a conference. It is important to understand how to download it because of this.

Step1Launch the web browser on your computer and go to Zoom.us to access the Zoom website. In the website's footer, at the bottom of the page, click Download tab and the options are visible as follows:
