### Is Skype Zoom free?

Skype was created to make it possible for individuals to interact with one another for free, no matter where they are.

Whether you started the call or are only a participant, you may start it as long as you have the link. Once you have a link, you may use it whenever you wish to join the conversation. Links can be used again in the future.

### How do I open Skype Zoom?
