 Have you come across an interesting place and don’t want to forget where it is? Google Maps allows you to save locations to various lists. You can then easily retrieve as well as find directions to these places without needing to search for them again.

##  How Saving Places on Google Maps Helps You

 Let’s say you’re at a really good restaurant, and you’d like to come back again. The problem is it’s easy to forget the names of places and their locations. It can be very frustrating when you're trying to remember a place and you just can't seem to recall it. This is where Google Maps' saved locations feature comes in handy.

 Luckily, when you [save a place on Google Maps](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ensuring-realness-in-your-instagram-photos/), the service saves the place’s name, location, and other information. Later, when you come back to your saved location list, you can find all your saved places and other information about them.

 This means you can find and return to your favorite places even years later without having to recall their names or locations. But that's not all it can do.

##  Create Custom Saved Lists and Add Notes to Them

 Google Maps allows you to create custom saved lists so you can categorize the places to your liking. For example, [you can have all your favorite restaurants in one category](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-revisiting-old-photos-sending-them-as-snaps-on-snapchat/) while all your favorite entertainment venues go into another. This organizational feature helps ensure you quickly find the places you want to visit.

 Another option Maps offers is the ability to add notes to your saved places. This allows you to add your own thoughts about a place while saving it. For example, if a restaurant offers a buffet between 12 PM and 3 PM, you can add that information as a note while adding the restaurant to the list. The next time you check your saved location list, you’ll find this personal note.

##  Use Voice Search to Find Places

 Google Maps supports voice search, meaning you can find places by just speaking into your phone (as opposed to typing the names of places). This is especially useful when you’re driving, and it's another reason to save locations.

 You can [label places in Maps](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/seamless-integration-of-dvd-playback-on-your-system-for-2024/) and speak those labels to find your favorite places. For example, I could add “Mahesh’s Favorite Bakery” as a label to a bakery. The next time I want to find this place using voice search, simply say, “Find me directions to Mahesh’s favorite bakery" instead of reciting the bakery's name. Google Maps will locate that place and show you the directions to it.

 To add a label to a place, launch Google Maps on your phone. Find your favorite place, select it, and tap "More" (in the same bar where you see "Directions"). From the open menu, select "Add Label." Type a label for the selected place and tap the flag icon. And that’s it.

##  Find Directions and Busy Times at Your Saved Places

 Once you save a place, you can quickly find all kinds of directions to that place. For example, you can find driving directions, public transport options, walking directions, and more. You can choose your preferred transport method, and Maps will show you directions accordingly.

[Maps also show you the busy times of the selected location](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-prime-hd-video-capture-ultimate-recorder-reviews-for-2024/). Once you access your saved location list and tap a place, you can see how busy (or not busy) it is. This helps you plan your visit to that place.

 You’ve created a list and added your favorite place to it. To add a note to your saved place, find the place on the list and tap the "Add a Note About This Place" textbox.
