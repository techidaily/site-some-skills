## The Ultimate Guide to Blurring iPhone Pics at Zero Cost

While taking the images is merely the process of tapping the ‘Capture’ button, getting them from the correct angle and with proper lighting is an art. Because many smartphones nowadays offer the best picture quality when it comes to snapping photos using their camera, it is imperative to learn **how to blur a picture on iPhone** so the main subject grabs the limelight, hence making the other objects in the background get the least focus.

There are multiple ways to get this done. For instance, the background of the photos can be blurred while shooting even on the older iPhones.

You can learn how to do this by following the steps given below:

**Step 1: Get to the Camera App**

Use the method explained above to launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone. Because it’s an old model that doesn’t have Portrait mode, you can stay in the **PHOTO** mode.
