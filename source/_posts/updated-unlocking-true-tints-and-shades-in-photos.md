Do you want to change the color of any particular shirt in the photo? Then use Adobe Photoshop and open its main interface. Go to its "Quick Selection" tool and select around the shirt to change its color. Now go to the bottom right and click on "New Adjustment Layer," and tap on "Hue and Saturation.”

On the tab of hue and saturation, you can use hue, saturation, and brightness to change the color of your selected shirt. Just use their draggers to change the color, brightness, and saturation according to your preferences. After making all the changes, you would need to find and tune the selection to get rid of minor flaws.

### 2\. Tips 2: Use Black and White Colors

Another option in Adobe Photoshop photo color editor to add black or white color to the shirt is by using the "Hue and Saturation Adjustment Layer.” For this, you need to create a group and then apply a layer mask to it by reducing its saturation. After that, you can apply a hue and saturation adjustment layer to it to have a white or black effect on the shirt.

The reason for using different adjustment layers is that it can produce natural black or white effects on the shirt flawlessly. To control the intensity of a black or white color shirt, create a “Levels Adjustment Layer” and drag the points shown on the screen to build the right intensity of black or white color on the shirt.

Now do the tuning by navigating to the layer mask and also select the layers. After that, Tap on "CTRL+E" to merge all the settings and layers, and you will get your desired color.

### 3\. Tip 3: Add Color to White Object

If you want to add color to your black or white shirt, you can do it by “Hue and Saturation Adjustment Layer.” On this layer, tap on “Colorize” and choose the color you want to add. Another technique is to create a “Fill Adjustment Layer” and then change the blending mode into “Multiple.” Now, click on the “Color Picker,” and you can pick and choose your preferred color. If you want to add a dark color rather than a subtle color, change the mode to “Screen.”

### 5\. Tip 5: Choose Object Color Range

Do you want to change the color of a specific part of the image? You can do this on Adobe Photoshop photo color editor by going to the "Quick Selection Tool" and then applying the colors, but it may leave edges and curves of the object.

### 6\. Tip 6: Use Blend IF

If you want to change the color of leaves on a tree, you can use the “Blend IF” option of Adobe Photoshop to precisely do the changes. Start with duplicating the existing layer and then hiding the second layer. Double click on the layer to open the menu and then use “Blend IF” sliders. This option works when you drag the sliders to black points, and it automatically hides the dark pixels of your photo.

Similarly, if you drag the “Blend IF” sliders towards white pints, it can hide the light pixels. To hide any specific color from the picture, you can click on “Channels” and then select the color you want to eradicate completely.

![select the channel color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-9.jpg)

This method only hides color based on their luminance values; however, this loads the entire layer when loading the active pixels. Regardless, this can be changed into transparency. For this, you need to select the layer by right-clicking and selecting the option of “Convert to Smart Object.”

![convert to smart object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-10.jpg)

It helps the user create transparency across the layer. After hiding the layer and coming back to another object-specific layer, you can create a certain change in effect through adjustment layers. For instance, you can create a “Hue and Saturation” adjustment layer. With the above settings, Photoshop applies this as a layer mask for you. Use the sliders across the set layer to change the color across the selected areas.

### 7\. Tip 7: Use Online Photo Editor to Change Colors

If you don’t have an offline tool like Adobe Photoshop, you can use an online photo color editor to replace the colors quickly. In this part, we will suggest [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/) photo color editor change the photo colors efficiently.

To change the color, navigate to this tool and upload the images. Then, head to the “Replace Color” option from the left section and click on it. On the menu of “Replace Color,” select the box next to “Source Color” to choose the color you want to replace. Use an eyedropper to select any color for your image.
