## Part2: Difference Between Slow Motion And Time Lapse

 Often, many of you confuse between a slow-motion video and a timelapse video. There is a difference between the two. Do you wish to see a recording for a longer time on screen? The slow-motion videos do exactly the same. A video’s motion is captured at a higher framerate than the actual speed of playback. i.e. the time observation is slowed down. For instance, if you add slow-motion effect to a 2 seconds video, it appears to last longer on the screen.

 Whereas, a timelapse video is a sort of fast-forward. A time span that has lasted for long but while depicting it on screen, you speed up the perception of time or the actual time is the time-lapse.

## Conclusion

 Now, creating slow-motion videos on your Android is easy and fun with the above-mentioned apps. If you are searching for an app that can help in creating the slow-motion videos on your Android device or add slow-motion effect to an existing video, check out the best 6 apps for slow-motion video on Android.
