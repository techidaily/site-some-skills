## Unleashing Creativity Without Costly Fees - Discover Alternatives to ChatGPT's Imagery!

Free ChatGPT users can now generate two images with DALL-E 3 each day. It's better than nothing, but the two-per-day limit doesn't make much sense.

 The DALL-E 3 image generator is nearing its first birthday. Obviously, a year is a long time in the world of AI. DALL-E 3 will soon be superseded by the GPT-4o image generator, though it's still an incredibly capable tool in its own right, which is why full access requires a $20 monthly ChatGPT Plus subscription.

 You can tap into DALL-E 3 by asking ChatGPT to create an image. A prompt like "create a cute watercolor image of a chicken with a farmer on a white background" is a good starting point. Giving the AI additional context, like "I want to use the image as a blog header," can lead to more precise results.

 However, [Microsoft Designer](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-instagram-time-keeper-learning-to-rewind/) (formerly [Bing Image Creator](https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/advanced-speed-adjustment-techniques-in-media-editing-for-2024/)) and Microsoft Copilot offer _unlimited_ DALL-E 3 image generation for free, with 15 high-speed outputs per day. [Google Gemini](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/14286560) and [Meta AI](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-window-warriors-choose-the-best-capture-apps/) can do free image generation as well. There are also several free and open-source tools, like [Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com/) or [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/), that can get the job done.

 Limited DALLE-E 3 access in the ChatGPT free plan isn't a _bad_ thing. There are plenty of people who exclusively rely on ChatGPT for occasional or frequent tasks. Still, this feels like an overhanded and dishonest way of driving [ChatGPT Plus subscriptions](https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-icloud-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-smoothly-by-drfone-ios/). Free users will rarely get the image they want in two tries, and unless they do some research, they won't realize that Bing provides DALLE-3 at zero cost.

 You could argue that the ChatGPT free membership is designed to drive subscriptionsâ€”duh, of course it is. Here's the thing; OpenAI's free GPT-4o access is far more generous than this image generation feature. A free user can spend hours interacting with GPT-4o before they hit their daily limit, and when that limit is reached, they're simply downgraded to GPT-3.

 Things may change for the better when GPT-4o image generation rolls out. Free users could have a few passes at GPT-4o image generation before being knocked down to unlimited DALL-E 3 each day, for example. But OpenAI hasn't provided a release date for GPT-4o image generation, and it hasn't announced future plans for free access.
