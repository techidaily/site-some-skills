## How to Transfer Videos and Photos from a PC to an iPhone

 There are a lot of data transfer apps available at the App Store, but each of these apps is pricey, so if you want to save money on transferring your photos and videos from a PC to an iPhone try using one of the following methods.

* [With iCloud App](#part2)
* [With Google Photo](#part3)

**Cons:** The syncing process will delete all the files you are transferring from your computer, so you must take the time to store all of the videos and photos you want to move to an iPhone into a new folder in order to avoid losing the data stored on your computer.

**Preparation:** Before you proceed any further you must make sure that the iCloud Photo Library is disabled on your iPhone, because you won't be able to sync your data with iTunes. go to "Settings" on iPhone > get access to "iCloud" and find "Photos" > turn off "iCloud Photo Library."

#### 1\

 Place your photos in a single folder on your PC, to make the transfer faster and easier, and then connect your iPhone to a PC with a USB cable. Open the iTunes, and locate the mobile device icon in the software.

#### 3\

 Start transferring your photos or videos by clicking on the Sync button located at the lower end your screen.

### With iCloud App

**Cons:** Using this method to move your photos and videos is slower, and you'll also have to pay attention to the size of the files because the storage space is limited.
