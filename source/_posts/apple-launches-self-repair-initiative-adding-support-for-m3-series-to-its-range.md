## Apple Launches Self-Repair Initiative, Adding Support for M3 Series to Its Range

Apple's self repair program allows you to get original parts, documentation, and even equipment to repair your Apple devices, such as your iPhone or your Mac. However, it was frequently criticized because it lacked a number of Apple devices, most notably the latest Macs. To Apple's credit, it has slowly been fixing this by adding several of its new devices every so often. Now, the company seems to have mostly caught up, as it has just added support for M3 Macs.

 Apple is expanding its self-service repair program to include the M3 iMac, M3 14-inch MacBook Pro, and M3 16-inch MacBook Pro, as revealed in recently published support documents. The last time the program was updated [was in December](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/top-7-causes-behind-non-responsive-iphone-touchscreen-solutions-inside/), where it added the M2 15-inch MacBook Air as well as the iPhone 15 series. Now, with the addition of the newer M3-powered Macs, you can get Macs and iPhones repaired yourself regardless of how new they are.

 Additionally, Apple announced the availability of Apple Diagnostics for M3 Macs in the United States starting early next month, enabling you to test device functionality and identify potential repair needs. The System Configuration process for all Mac models in countries with self-service repair support will also be streamlined, eliminating the need to contact support for the final step of a repair.

 The support documents detail the replacement procedures for various components such as the bottom casing of the MacBook Pro and provide lists of required part numbers and tools for repairs. If you happen to need to repair your MacBook in the future, this might be a useful resource to checkout and read through.

 It's worth noting that the self repair program still has a lot of issues. For starters, you can only fix Macs and iPhones, and if you own something like an iPad, you'll still need to send it over to Apple for repairs. Still, it's better than nothing, and we certainly hope Apple gives some love to the rest of its products as well. You can [check out the self-repair store](https://selfservicerepair.com/en-US/home) for links to manuals, replacement parts, and other resources.
