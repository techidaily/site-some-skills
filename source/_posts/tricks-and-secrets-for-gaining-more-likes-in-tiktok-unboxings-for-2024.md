### Tip 1: Keep Your Videos Short

Primarily, look at the basic factor of TikTok that actually attract a viewer. The first thing you should keep in mind while creating an unboxing video is to make it short. People who want to watch long videos can do that on YouTube, but the TikTok audience loves short videos. As you already know, TikTok allows you to create videos of 15 seconds, 60 seconds, 3 minutes, and 10 minutes.

However, the optimal recommended length for good and engaging TikTok's 21 to 34 seconds. TikTok comprises hyper-specific algorithms which could detect if the viewer watched your video to the end or just passed it up. Thus, ensure you don't make long **unboxing TikTok** videos, which will bore the viewers.

### Tip 2: Use the Right Hashtag to Reach Your Audience

One of the most common and effective ways to increase followers on any platform is to use the hashtag. No matter if you are working on **kawaii unboxing TikTok** or a technical one, always use the right hashtag. It is like you are taking part in the conversation on social media.

Furthermore, hashtags lead to high user engagement and promote your brand. Therefore, if you have no idea about picking hashtags related to your product, the table mentioned below will help you:

| **Hashtag**        | **Total Views** |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| **#Unboxing**      | 2.9B            |
| **#unboxingasmr**  | 585.8M          |
| **#unboxingtoys**  | 427.6M          |
| **#unboxingvideo** | 362.8M          |

### Tip 3: Make Your Videos Compatible with Small Screen

No one watches TikTok on big screens. Before uploading a video, ensure it is compatible with a small screen. You can also shoot your video in both portrait and landscape mode, but 90% of people prefer to watch in portrait mode. Also, cross-check the **unboxing TikTok** resolution before posting it and make sure it's 1080 x1920.

However, if the video's resolution exceeds 1080p, don't panic because TikTok will automatically minimize it. Other than this, keep the video at 9:16 for a better watching experience. As for the file size, it can vary with your device. For Android, it's 72MB, and for Apple, it's 287.6MB. The file types for unboxing videos TikTok support are MOV and MP4.

### Tip 4: Film in Well-Lit Condition

It is evident that if your TikTok has no captivating and significant points, no one will watch it. Before shooting a video, ensure the environment is neat, clean, and tidy. Moreover, focus on the lighting of a room and try to use aesthetic lights that can cast delightful impressions on users. Play nice background music that can cast soothing effects on the users.

Create a theme color for your page to give a personalized look to your TikTok. These are very minute details that are mostly eliminated, but they have a part in the growth of your **unboxing TikTok**.

### Tip 5: Be Honest and Personable

Now, many content creators boost a product that is actually not that good. Before selecting a product for an **unboxing video TikTok**, confirm whether it is worth it or not. Never give false information about the product because it will cause a negative impression on viewers. Always explain the item's specs and price and guide the viewer if that is budget-friendly.

Above all, categorize the products in variable names like bags, shoes, and clothes so viewers can watch videos without hassle. If you are working on makeup and skincare products, mention their expiry dates, size, and other factors.
