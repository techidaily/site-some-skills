Google has changed its Google Market to Google Play, and integrated Google Bookstore. 

Now we can download Google Books, android apps, movie, and music there. 

For reading an eBook, most people choose Kindle, while few people like reading eBooks on Android Phone. But Google made it impossible to read Google Books on Kindle.

But Nothing is difficult to the man who will try, we finally find the methods to make Google Books available on Kindle. 

All you need to do is 3 things.  
[#1 - Download Google Books to your computer.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)  
[#2 - Remove the Google Books DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)  
[#3 - Convert its format then transfer to Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Download Google Books to your computer

Google Books offers several ways to read them, including read on WebBrowser, on Android App(you must have Android Device which has installed the Play Books App and register with your Google ID), on IOS App, and download to computer.

To read them on Kindle, we choose the last one.

Purchase the book first, then enter the book information page, choose "**How To Read**".

![read google books](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/how-to-read.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Then scroll the page to the bottom, there are two options: **DOWNLOAD EPUB**, **DOWNLOAD PDF**. You can choose the format as you like, but we recommend you choose ePub format, it is more suitable for the majority of popular eReaders.

![google epub or pdf](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/epub-or-pdf.png)

After the downloading finishes, you will get an .acsm file, it can't be read directly, you should convert it to ePub format. 

[Learn How to Convert .acsm to .ePub by freeware](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) 

Now you get ePub files, congratulations! You can read the Google Books on your computer now even if you are off-line! But to read them on Kindle, you still have a few things to do.

### Remove Google Books DRM

Google Play books are protected by Adobe DRM which prevents you converting, sharing or even printing them freely. If you want to read them without any obstacle on Kindle Fire (HD), you need to decrypt the DRM protection at first.

In the previous step, if you choose "Download EPUB", you won't simply get an .ePub file but an .acsm file. You can't read the .acsm file by any eReaders.

Now you need to download and install a program called [Adobe Digital Editions](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html), then open your downloaded .acsm file with ADE. If you have registered your ADE with correct Adobe ID, you will see the download process window as the image shows.

![download ade](https://www.epubor.com/images/ade-download.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
When the download process finishes, make sure you can read the book in ADE.

![read acsm via ade](https://www.epubor.com/images/ade-reading.jpg)

Now download and install [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), the program will find the book automatically then decrypt it, if you do the job strictly as the guide above, there won't be any problem.

Run the program, usually it will detect and upload your books automatically if they are saved in the default ADE path. Once you drag them from the left side to the main interface of this tool, all your books will be decrypted quickly. Then simply click "Decrypted" to open the output folder. This is all you need to do for removing DRM from Google Play Books. You can't find an easier-to-operate software in the planet.

Is it really necessary to convert the google epub to mobi for the Kindle Fire HD?

 I just bought and downloaded an epub from google, and opened it in the nook app (side-loaded using 1mobile).

 This worked fine on a Kindle Fire HDX.

It seem Epubor only converts 20 % of the ADE files into epub, for the rest you must pay a license?!

Are you using the trail version? The trial version will allow you decrypt and convert 20% content of each book. The license version will give you the full content of each book.

Looks like it would work, but doesn't mention anything about buying a license. Costs around $25, which is way more than what I want to pay to convert 1 book

What won’t work: 

 Books bought on Google Play won't work on Amazon Kindle devices.You can’t transfer books using a Chromebook.Your highlights and notes won't be available when you read your books on an e-Reader.
