## First Impression of LG 360 VR

### Design of LG 360 VR

 The 360 VR does not look like other headsets present in the market and in this occurrence, this is not a good feature. Certainly, it is tough, maybe terrible even, to make someone look cool while having a VR headset on their head. But with the design of 360 VR, it is quite sure that engineers have made no attempt to resolve this issue. The headset sports a look similar to what common in the 1980s imagined a futuristic invention would look like. It actually looks like a product with a low-cost, NHS-prescribed article for modifying poor vision.

### How to Set up LG 360 VR headset

* The headset will not work normally when it is connected to the LG G5 phone if you have connected LG Hi-Fi plus, LG CAM Plus or any other device that is not of the G5 module.

### LG 360 VR Performance

 When you ponder that it is the LG G5 phone that is actually doing all the work in terms of actually driving the 360 VR's practices, you would at least assume steady performance. We know that the G5 is one of the most influential smartphones present in the market, including an Adreno 530 GPU, Snapdragon 820 and a 4GB RAM. Unfortunately, the first experience with the 360 VR’s performance is unsatisfactory to say the minimum. Having a 920 x 720 resolution per eye, this headset provides a much lower resolution rate as compared to all other virtual reality headsets present in the market. Although using it is a rollercoaster ride through various mixed experiences.

## Key features of the LG 360 VR headset

* It has 1.88 inches IPS LCD display.
* The PPE resolution is 920 x 720.
* The PPI is 639.
* It consists of adjustable lenses.

* A headphone jack of 3.5mm
* A 6-axis proximity sensor is also present.

* It’s an LG product.
* Price is $220 approx.

##### Pros

### More about LG 360 VR headset

 LG 360 VR is a virtual reality device designed by LG. It was actually released with LG G5 and used to promote this phone. LG 360 VR has an internal built-in display, unlike the Gear VR designed by Samsung, which also provides a unit plugging for power directly to the phone. The headset can be controlled from the smartphone screen by just tapping and swiping. LG, however, designed this device to enjoy the virtual reality experience, but the device is not up to the mark. If you haven’t bought this device yet, it is highly advised not to buy this one. It is not a very good design and its performance is also not very good.

 However, with a cost of around $200 to $220, LG 360 VR is a very expensive device with a doubly cost of Samsung Gear VR. In addition to that, it only is compatible with LG G5\. Now, it was better if, with this price and compatibility of just one, 360 VR provided a better experience, but it is not a good device to use.

 In crux, LG’s this device isn't somewhat you'd want to attire in public, and when you ponder that one of the assistances of a mobile headset is that you are not tied to a luxurious gaming rig, LG certainly should have put in some more energy when it comes to the design of 360 VR. If we are going to turn out to be a realm of VR zombies with headsets continually tied to our skulls, then we would probably want those units which let us live in style.
