## Expanded Google Circle Search Now Available on Additional Smartphones & Tablets

Circle to Search has been one of the best additions to our Android phones in recent memory. Now, as part of Samsung and Google's ongoing collaboration, Circle to Search is coming to a bunch of additional Galaxy devices.

 Samsung has just announced the expansion of [Circle to Search](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-compiling-leading-short-form-video-editors-iosandroid-edition/) to the Galaxy A series smartphones and Galaxy Tab S9 FE series tablets. Samsung says Circle to Search has gained popularity since its debut on the Galaxy S24 series, allowing people to make searches from anywhere just by circling the screen. Circle to Search is also available on Google Pixel devices, and a limited version [rolled out to the iPhone Google app recently](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-draft-to-edit-essential-film-techniques-via-youtube/).

 With the recent addition of features like full-page translation, homework help, and QR/barcode scanning, Circle to Search has become a pretty nifty tool to have around. It's great to see more smartphones adopting it now. Google is also starting to [roll it out to the desktop Google Chrome web browser](https://media-tips.techidaily.com/quick-and-effective-techniques-for-converting-video-output-vob-to-movie-file-mov-web-based-and-standalone-solutions/).

 TM Roh, President and Head of Mobile Experience Business at Samsung Electronics, has said that "these updates unlock new possibilities for the Galaxy A series and Galaxy Tab S9 FE series and reinforce our commitment to providing cutting-edge technology for more Galaxy users." He went on to add that "we are dedicated to bringing best-in-class AI technology to a broader audience, empowering users with the option to work more efficiently, create more freely and enjoy richer, more personalized interactions with their devices.‚Äù

 It's great to see Circle to Search rolling out to more mid-range and lower-end devices, instead of remaining as a feature only accessible to newer and high-end phones. The feature is still a long way from becoming a widely-available Android feature, but hopefully, Google will continue working with Samsung and other device manufacturers to make it happen.
