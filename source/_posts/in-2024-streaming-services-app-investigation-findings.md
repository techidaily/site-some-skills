## Part 3\. How to use VideoShow Video Editor App?

Now that we know about it, we will discuss how we can use it.

### Import

First, click on the video edit button to import your media files to the VideoShow video editor. Then it will take you to a menu where all your mobile's media will appear. You can select the media you want to import and click on the add button. The flaws in its importing are that it cannot separate your media in such a way that your pictures and videos are in different sections. However, thankfully there are separations of albums in it, making it easy for you to find the media you want. Also, in the free version, you cannot import any video of higher resolution. You need to convert them to some lower resolution for it.

### Filters

You can use filters by clicking on the filters option, which will be at the bottom of your screen. Then it will take you to its filter library, where you can choose the filter of your choice. And then, click on the Tick button to apply that filter to your video. Some filters are free, and for some, you must purchase their premium package.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Stickers

You can add different stickers to your video using it as well. For this purpose, you have to select the sticker's option from the bottom menu of it. A library will open from which you can choose them. After choosing your favorite stickers, click the Apply the changes button at the top right corner.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Speed adjustment

Its speed adjustment feature is also not less than any of the above, as it can help you to make your video slow or fast. It will surely provide you with a cinematic effect. To use this feature, you must click the Edit button. Then you have to click on the Clip edit option and then the speed option. A setting will appear from which you can easily adjust your video's speed. It is a free feature. It does not require any premium package from you.

### Export

Now you click on the export button at the top right of your screen for this. After that, a menu asks which resolution you want to export your content. Only those who use a free version of the software can export videos at SD resolution. You must then select the "save to gallery" option after selecting the video resolution and frame rate.

#### **Highly advanced features:**

### Disadvantages

Some of its disadvantages are the following:

#### **Export Quality:**

You can only export your video in SD quality using a free version. To export it in HD, FHD, and 4K resolution, you must purchase the premium version of it. Moreover, you cannot select the frame rate above 30 in the free version.

#### **Paid features:**

As we have described, not all this application's features are free. Some of them are premium which requires you to buy their premium version. Using its free version is a big drawback, as it develops mainly to make users buy its premium version.

#### **Watermark:**

The biggest con of using VideoShow is that they also put their watermark on the exported videos, which ruins the quality and look of your videos.
