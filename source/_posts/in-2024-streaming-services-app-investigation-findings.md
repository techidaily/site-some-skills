## Part 3\. How to use VideoShow Video Editor App?

Now that we know about it, we will discuss how we can use it.

### Import

First, click on the video edit button to import your media files to the VideoShow video editor. Then it will take you to a menu where all your mobile's media will appear. You can select the media you want to import and click on the add button. The flaws in its importing are that it cannot separate your media in such a way that your pictures and videos are in different sections. However, thankfully there are separations of albums in it, making it easy for you to find the media you want. Also, in the free version, you cannot import any video of higher resolution. You need to convert them to some lower resolution for it.

### Filters

You can use filters by clicking on the filters option, which will be at the bottom of your screen. Then it will take you to its filter library, where you can choose the filter of your choice. And then, click on the Tick button to apply that filter to your video. Some filters are free, and for some, you must purchase their premium package.
