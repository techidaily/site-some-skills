## New U.S. Policies Promote Rapid Electrification of Cars with Revised Emissions Standards

The transition from gas-powered vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs) is taking a while, but it's a necessary step. Gas-fueled cars are among the biggest polluters in our planet, being a significant contributor to CO2 emissions, so moving to electric cars and other forms of transit are important. The United States wants that to happen sooner rather than later, though, and new restrictions on car emissions are being put in place to usher in the EV era more quickly.

 The EPA has implemented stringent new regulations on vehicle emissions after intense lobbying and deliberation. These rules, a core element of the Biden administration's climate change strategy, are meant to accelerate the transition to [electric vehicles (EVs)](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-charting-2023s-social-trend-peaks-in-graphs/) in the United States. Under these regulations, EVs are projected to constitute up to 56% of new passenger vehicles by 2030-2032, meeting Biden's ambitious target set in 2021.

 As per these rules, car manufacturers will need to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants starting with model years 2027-2032, so the first cars that will be subject to these regulations will start releasing in 2026\. The rules apply to manufacturers' entire fleets of light-duty and medium-duty vehicles rather than being a hard and fast rule for all vehicles. This means that car manufacturers will still be able to release some cars with higher-emissions as long as it releases other cars that are cleaner. It should also be noted that the regulations do not mandate EVs exclusively, but rather, they set stringent emissions standards for entire vehicle fleets. Car makers don't _have_ to release EVs, but at some point, they'll be forced to make some in order to meet these rules.

 Of course, as more and more EVs are sold, the country needs to adapt to them. For example, more charging infrastructure needs to be rolled out so that they eventually become as common of a sight as traditional gas stations. These regulations don't enter effect immediately, and even when they do, the transition will still be gradual. It will be a few more years before everyone is using an electric vehicle, but we're slowly getting there.
