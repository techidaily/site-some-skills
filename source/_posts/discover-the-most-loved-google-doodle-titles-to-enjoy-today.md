 Google keeps its main search page fresh with fun doodles that change every couple of days. Occasionally, the doodle is an actual game that you can play. These games are archived and can be played after their time on the homepage has passed. They're perfect for passing the time without needing to download anything.

##  #1: [Baseball](http://www.google.com/doodles/fourth-of-july-2019) 

![doodle baseball](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-29_16-52-45.png) 

 There have been several sports-based doodle games, but the one we spent the most time on was Baseball from the 2019 4th of July.

##  #2: [Pac-Man](http://www.google.com/doodles/fourth-of-july-2019) 

![google pac-man](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-29_17-02-09.png) 

 Everyone knows Pac-Man. It's a classic for a reason. The Doodle version is just as fun as always.
