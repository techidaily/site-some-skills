## Part 1\. What is X App?

**X Video Editor app** is an Android-exclusive app that has the ability to create more spectacular and captivating videos. The app has an easy-to-use and simple interface and comes with all the major video editing tools, such as effects, filters, and themes.

X is sometimes called an all-in-one movie editing app due to its wide range of features. The app has many features, like being able to play multiple videos at the same time and convert videos into other audio (FLX, WMA, ASF) and video (VOB, AVI, FLV) formats.

Another exciting feature of the X app is its built-in music library, which lets you choose from a wide range of music to add to your video. You can also add your own music, photos, and effects to personalize your video.

### Download

**X video editor app OS** is specifically designed for Android devices.

You can also [download](https://ccm.net/downloads/internet/8967-xvideostudio-video-editor-for-android-apk/#download-xvideostudio-video-editor-windows) and use X on your PC. But since it is an Android app, you will need an emulator such as BlueStack to use the app.

### Price

X is available for free to use and does not require any subscription.

## Part 2\. Key features X App

The X app has a variety of features that make video editing simple and fun, including:

**Unique Templates and Effects:** The app offers more than 100 pre-made themes and effect packs, allowing you to choose the ideal and perfect look for your videos quickly. While saving you time during video editing, it also ensures that your video is of the finest quality.

**Simple And Intuitive Interface:** X's interface is clean and simple as it is designed to be easy to use, even for first-time users.

**Separate Audio from Video:** The app offers a unique feature that lets you separate audio content from your video and convert it into mp3, FLC, WMA, and ASF formats.

**Layers:** With the app, you can work on your project in different layers, such as images, video, overlays, and effects. If you want to redo or undo some improvements, it's easy to go back and track your edits.

**Pimp:** You can add text, transitions, effects, and filters to your videos, which is great for making different clips like tutorials, FAQs, or comical videos. This convenience allows you to be creative and produce different content your viewers will love.

**No Watermark or Ads:** One of the best things about X is that it does not display any ads. Moreover, no watermark is added to your edited videos.

## Part 3\. How To Use X App?

Over 100 pre-made themes are available on the app, allowing you to create videos for different occasions such as Halloween, Christmas, weddings, or birthdays. X also includes a redo and undo option to help you keep your workflow error-free.

Moreover, it is compatible with various video and audio formats and lets you separate audio sound from your video clips to convert it into ASF, FLC, WAA, or mp3 format. X is free to download and has an intuitive interface that is easy to use for editing any kind of video.

The app displays no ads during the editing process and does not add any watermark on your edited clips. Furthermore, it is safe to use, which means you don't have to worry about losing your data to any malware.

**Disadvantages**:

The X video editor app is not available on the Google Play Store. Therefore, you have to download it from a source that offers its APK version. Furthermore, while editing your videos on the app, you might face a problem with layers adjustment as they sometimes do not align properly.

## Part 5\. The best X App Alternative for PC
