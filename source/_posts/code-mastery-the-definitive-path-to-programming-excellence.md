 Registration Code  
 Epubor Ultimate for Mac

 Y36MT2H-X66PZ5-GVY6BZ-XYUQJP-UF7JMUZ  
 but every time I try to use the program the license has expired, and now I have retrieved it three times and I'm not able to retrieve any more.  
 Why does my license expire so often?

I need help reinstalling Epubor Ultimate on my laptop, that is now running Windows 10\. The Program will not work after the update to windows 10\. I tried updating the version of Epubor Ultimate that I was running both through the program itself and through the link on the website.

[Am I free??](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/28/2019 1:09:25 PM 

I want to make sure I’m not paying for epubor ultimate. Back in December I signed up for the free trial version (30 days). I do not remember giving my credit card information (though my memory may be playing tricks on me). I expected the program to stop working after 30 days, but it didn’t. Since this happened 8 months ago, I don’t remember the steps I took to install the program. How can I know if Epubor is charging me for using this program? Everything works just fine, which is highly suspicious. Every time I open it, a window asking for my registration code pops up, but I just close it and use the program. Does this window pops up for those of you who have payed for Epubor? Also, the program (in the configurations part) says that I’m licensed to a free trial. I guess it should have my email there if I had paid for this.  
 Maybe I’m being paranoid. Help??

[Lifetime license <-> 365 days after being generated- HOWTO?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/21/2024 2:26:50 PM 

Hi, I purchased Epubor Ultimate with lifetime license. My computer broke down, and I want to run Epubor Ultimate on my other computer.  
 So I downloaded and installed. Entered my license key =&gt; NoGo (License code can only be used to register in 365 days after being generated, but you can retrieve code here if your license is not expired.

 I can go to 2Checkout, no issue to find my purchase, but code is the same as the one I have originally. So how can I do a reinstall after 365 days?

 Please send me a new code. Thank you.  
 My purchase email = domusbvba@fastmail.fm  
 My order number = 202596948
