## Part 2: How do I add subtitles to a video without any software?

Although using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software is the best way to add SRT to MP4, you can also get the job done without downloading any software. One of the few online tools that allows this kind of operation is Clideo. Yes, Clideo can be used to attach SRT files to MP4 quickly and easily.

With Clideo, you can add subtitles to a video on any device including Mac, Windows, Android, and iPhone. Plus, it supports basic editing features that can always come in handy to make the addition of Subtitles do video just like a walk in the park.

Follow the stepwise guide explained below to add SRT to MP4 without software.

Step1 Visit [Clideo online tool](https://clideo.com/add-subtitles-to-video) directly add the hyperlink to the text Clideo Online Tool

Step2 Click on the ‘Add’ button to upload the MP4 video file that you want to add SRT to from your computer or mobile device. You can add files with a size up to 500MB.

![click on add button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-srt-to-mp4-with-clideo-online-tool-1.jpg)

Step3 Once you've successfully uploaded the MP4 video file, you'll be given options that you want to use to add SRT to MP4\. You can use ‘Add Manually’, to add the subtitles manually, ‘Upload SRT’ to upload the SRT file, or ‘Generate Automatically’ to allow the Clideo to generate the subtitles automatically.

![add subtitles manually](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-srt-to-mp4-with-clideo-online-tool-2.jpg)

We recommend using the ‘Upload SRT’ option to add the subtitles file. The ‘Generate Automatically’ option is still a ‘Beta’ feature, so it might not work perfectly.

Step4 Now, click on ‘Styles’ to choose how you want the text to appear on your video. From text font to background, color, size, and alignment.
