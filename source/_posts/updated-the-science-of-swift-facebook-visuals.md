## The Science of Swift Facebook Visuals

Facebook is a treasure trove of memories for a lot of people. Users with Facebook profiles use it as an identifier for other sites, seeing and sharing their videos and images, and much more. For some users, the video they post may not have the right video speed and want to change it. For example, if the length of the video is too long or the main person presenting the video is a slow speaker.

Unfortunately, there is no preset setting on Facebook to increase the playback speed. So, **can you speed up Facebook videos** still?

The answer is yes, mainly with the help of other tools. In this article, let's discuss the **Facebook video speed controller** options and how to carry out the process. Learn the step-by-step procedure and methods to carry it out on various device types here.

## The Best Solutions for Changing the Speed of Videos on Facebook

Multiple suitable solutions are available for users to try changing the Facebook videos they watch or play. One major reason to **speed up Facebook videos** for people is the typical size of this content. Facebook videos can get too long, which makes the process of watching them long and monotonous for some users.

There are no preset options to speed videos, and one might lose out on information when they choose another timestamp to start watching from. In this case, external solutions are useful, like the **Video Speed Controller Facebook** extension, Fast Playback, or third-party apps.

## Part I. Using Browser Extensions to Speed Up Facebook Video

One of the best solutions in the context of **how to change video speed on Facebook** is using browser extensions. These elements are easy to install into different browsers directly.

Some are compatible with different web browsers. In this case, you can use the same extension on various browsers. Plus, some major browsers come fitted with such extensions. In terms of video speed adjustment, though, **Facebook Video Speed Controller** is the best solution to try.

There, right-click on it and choose Unform Speed. You can change the speed range and other options in the window for Uniform Speed.

For advanced speed adjustment on videos, you can try our Speed Ramping functionality on Filmora. To use it, you can choose the video in the timeline and choose Speed icon > Speed Ramping. Or, right-click the video clip in the timeline and choose Speed Ramping.

## Conclusion

Facebook does not give the ability to change video speed for users. In this case, it is best to use different external solutions that you can install to make speed changes to the video. Browser extensions are useful for desktop users, while iOS and Android users can try apps.

However, it would be best to use third-party software like Filmora after downloading the video separately for superior-quality video speed changes. There are multiple speed settings, and each one is easy to use.

Try all the methods mentioned in this post and watch the video on Facebook at your preferred speed choice.
