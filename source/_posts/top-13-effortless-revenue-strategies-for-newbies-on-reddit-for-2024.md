## Best Subreddits for Making Money – 13 Recommendations

Subreddits are online communities within Reddit where users of common interests congregate. This allows you to find specific audiences where you can sell a unique product or offer a service.

Targeting a particular group of people based on their interests means eliminating many uninterested customers. Thus, you waste less time and less money in the process.
