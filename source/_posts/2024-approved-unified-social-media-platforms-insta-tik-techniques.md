### Why Reels are Preferred over TikTok Videos

There are a lot of benefits attached to reposting your TikTok videos to Instagram reels. Not only Instagram has broader popularity with a mature audience, but it is also considered to be more business friendly. Below are a few common reasons why you should prefer reels over TikTok videos.
