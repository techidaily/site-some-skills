## Transformative Audio Techniques: SRT Conversion Mastery

If it’s your first time handling an SRT file, there are high chances that you find it hard to open it, especially on platforms that are not .srt compatible. If you’re in such a situation, you could convert the SRT file to another format that’s compatible with the app you’re using. I know the question on your mind right now is “How do I convert SRT file?” Well, that’s why we’ve created this guide.

Here, we’ve discussed the most reliable methods to convert SRT to XML, SSA, TTML, and other different formats. So, what are you waiting for? Scroll down to find out how to convert SRT without stress.

## Part 1: Which Platforms support SRT files?

Before we discuss how to convert SRT to VTT, XML, TTML or any other format, it’ll be fair for us to know different social media and video platforms support what kind of subtitle formats to prevent future mistakes of opening VTT files on platforms that do not support VTT.

Below is a table displaying the different platforms that support what kind of subtitle files

| **Media Platform** | **Subtitle Formats Supported**                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| YouTube            | SubRip (.srt), Cheetah, CAP (.cap), WebVTT (.vtt), Timed Text (.ttml) |
| Twitter            | SubRip (.srt)                                                         |
| Facebook           | SubRip (.srt)                                                         |
| Instagram          | automatic captioning                                                  |
| Vimeo              | WebVTT (.vtt), SubRip (.srt), Timed Text (.ttml), Scenarist (.scc)    |
| LinkedIn           | SubRip (.srt)                                                         |
| Filmora            | SubRip (.srt)                                                         |
| VLC                | SubRip (.srt)                                                         |
| Final Cut Pro      | Scenarist (.scc)                                                      |
| Premiere pro       | Scenarist (.scc), MacCaption (.mcc), Timed Text (.ttml)               |

Now that we’ve already known platform subtitle compatibility, let’s dive into the main discussion without wasting much of your time.

## Part 2: How to Convert SRT to XML

Irrespective of the reason why you want to convert SRT to XML, the best way to get the job done is to use an online tool. Yes, this is because XML is a markup language based on Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), and you will require technical knowledge to understand files in such formats. The file format allows the sharing of structured information between two different programs, programs, and people, or among locally and shared networks.

The question is which online tool can convert SRT to XML? GoTranscript is the perfect SRT to XML converter that you need for this operation. This tool allows a straightforward SRT to XML conversion, and all it takes is just a few clicks. Read on to learn how to use the tool to convert SRT to XML.

Step1 Visit [GoTranscript Subtitle Converter](https://gotranscript.com/subtitle-converter)

Step2 Click the “Upload” button to upload your SRT file.

![convert srt to xml](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-1.jpg)

Step3 Select the file output format as “Flash XML (.xml)”. Then hit the “Convert” button to convert SRT to XML.

After the conversion process is finalized, you can download the XML file to your PC.

## Part 3: How to Convert SRT to SSA

Are you looking to convert SRT to SSA? SSA is a more advanced subtitle file format, and it’s usually used in anime fansubs to either store subtitle data with video or to overlay subtitles on video while it’s being encoded. The subtitle is not really popular among video content creators. However, when the need to convert SRT to SSA arises, an online tool is the right solution to help you get the job done without error. And luckily, the prior mentioned GoTranscipt subtitle converter also supports such a conversion process.

The steps below explain the process.

Step1 Visit [ToolSlick](https://toolslick.com/conversion/subtitle/srt-to-ssa)

Step2 Click the “Upload” button to upload your SRT file.

![convert srt to ssa](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-2.jpg)

Step3 Click Convert to begin SRT to SSA conversion.

![click convert to begin srt to ssa](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-3.jpg)

## Part 4: How to Convert SRT to TTML

Formerly known as DFXP (Distribution Format Exchange Profile), TTML (Time Texture Markup Language) is a time text in online media used in authoring, transcoding, or exchanging time text information used for subtitles and captions of videos. Although this format is supported in most media players, it cannot be used in web browsers. However, some people still have personal reasons why they want to convert SRT to TTML. Irrespective of what your reason to convert SRT to TTML is, you need the help of an online tool to carry out the operation.

We used the Better Converter online tool to convert SRT to TTML here. Just follow the following steps to perform the task.

Step1 Open [Better Converter](https://www.better-converter.com/Subtitles-Converter/Str-to-TTML-Subtitle-Converter) in your browser.

Step2 Use the Browse button to upload your SRT file.

![use browse to upload srt file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-5.jpg)

Step3 Once you upload the file, Better Converter will automatically convert it to TTML and download the file to your PC. You can find the file in the Download folder.

## Part 5: How to Convert SRT to SCC

There are effective steps that could also come in handy if you want to convert SRT to SCC. But first, what is SCC? SCC (Scenarist Closed Captions) is a closed caption file that is used as a sidecar file in video editing and production programs. Such programs use it in saving unrendered videos before exporting them to the final video format. Unlike SRT, this type of file format can only be opened in certain applications as it’s not a universally accepted format.

To convert SRT to SCC, you need an online converter, and here, we've explained the step-by-step process to convert SRT to SCC using REV online converter. It’s a reliable tool for the job.

Step1 Visit REV's[official website](https://www.rev.com/captionconverter)

Step2 Click on Select.SRT Files to upload the SRT file you want to convert to SCC.

![click on select srt files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-6.jpg)

Step3 Under Select Output Formats, choose Scenarist (.scc).

![choose scenarist](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-7.jpg)

Step4 Enter your email into the relevant box and click the Convert button.

![enter email into relevant box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-8.jpg)

The SRT file should be converted within a few minutes. Afterward, you can check for the converted files in your email.

## Part 6: How to Convert SRT to FCPXML

The FCPXML (Final Cut Pro XML) format is a totally different kind of caption file - it uses XML elements to describe data exchanged between the Final Cut Pro software and other third-party applications like Adobe Premiere Pro, LumaFusion, etc. This caption file format can only be used only on Final Cut Pro. So, if you're looking to convert SRT to FCPXML, you also need an online tool. Although the online tool that converts SRT to FCPXML is very limited, the Resolver Tool is one that does the job correctly. However, it only works efficiently with PC. So, we advise you use a PC for this operation.

See the steps to perform the task below:

Step1 Open Resolver Tools in your PC browser.

Step2 Click on Choose File to upload the SRT file you want to convert.

![click on choose file to upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-9.jpg)

Step3 Select FCPXML to SRT 1.5 and edit output as per requirement. Then, click Send File to begin SRT to FCPXML conversion.

![select fcpxml to srt 1.5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-10.jpg)

Once the conversion is completed, the FCPXML file will be saved to the Downloads folder on your PC automatically.

## Final Words

There’s no doubt that the SRT file format is one of the most popular subtitle formats that’s supported on almost all video players and social media platforms. However, there are situations when we might need to convert SRT to XML or any other subtitle format. In such cases, you can use the stepwise guides explained in this article to convert SRT. All it takes is just a few clicks.
