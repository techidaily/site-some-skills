## Top Selections for Speedy Facebook Video Transfers and Streams

Facebook is a treasure trove of memories for a lot of people. Users with Facebook profiles use it as an identifier for other sites, seeing and sharing their videos and images, and much more. For some users, the video they post may not have the right video speed and want to change it. For example, if the length of the video is too long or the main person presenting the video is a slow speaker.

Unfortunately, there is no preset setting on Facebook to increase the playback speed. So, **can you speed up Facebook videos** still?

The answer is yes, mainly with the help of other tools. In this article, let's discuss the **Facebook video speed controller** options and how to carry out the process. Learn the step-by-step procedure and methods to carry it out on various device types here.

### Upload the Target Video to A Speed Controller - Using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Next, you can make adjustments to the speed of the video you download offline using Wondershare Filmora. The software is accessible on desktop, in both Mac and Windows devices. Here, you will find many editing functions and features to optimize the quality and look of the videos.

But one of the best areas where Filmora excels is giving its users the ability to change speed easily through different methods. You can increase speed, reverse, or create slow-motion effect easily through the timeline icon for Speed or by double-clicking the video clip and choosing Speed Ramping. All the speed changing methods available here are simple to use and get used to on this software.

The three main speed adjustment methods of Filmora include:

**1\. Uniform Speed**

The most usable method to change the speed of the video you add to Filmora is via Uniform Speed. After inserting the file, you can click on it and drag it to the editor timeline. There, right-click on it and choose Unform Speed. You can change the speed range and other options in the window for Uniform Speed.

**2\. Speed Ramping**

For advanced speed adjustment on videos, you can try our Speed Ramping functionality on Filmora. To use it, you can choose the video in the timeline and choose Speed icon > Speed Ramping. Or, right-click the video clip in the timeline and choose Speed Ramping.

There are 6 preset templates available for keyframe-based speed adjustment on this software. You can choose one of the pre-made speed ramp options or customize your personalized speed ramping effect, controlling the keyframes. Adjust the audio pitch as well.

**3\. Change Speed via Timeline**

One of the easiest methods to **speed up Facebook videos** on Filmora is selecting and using the slider on the timeline to change speed. You can select the video clip and click on the icon for speed, shown as a tiny clock. Then, from the drop-down menu, click on Fast option and choose the speed between 2x to 100x.

**A Step-by-Step Guide to Speed Up a Video on Filmora**

While there are three different ways to change video speed, here are the steps for the most notable one- Unform Speed-based changes.

Step1 Launch the Filmora software and click on Create New Project.

Step2 Import the Facebook video you downloaded from your device. Drag it onto the editor timeline at the lower part of the screen.

Step3 You can right-click on the video clip in the timeline and choose Uniform from the drop-down menu. Or, choose the clip and click on the Speed icon above the timeline. Choose Uniform Speed.

![click on the speed icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/deep-dive-into-the-best-ways-to-speed-up-facebook-videos-11.jpg)

Step4 In the Uniform Speed panel, move the slider for speed to choose how much the video speed will increase. Click on Ripple Edit if there are two clips, and you automatically want the second one to start at the same speed as the former clip.

![move the slide for speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/deep-dive-into-the-best-ways-to-speed-up-facebook-videos-12.jpg)

Step5 Press the OK button. If needed, continue editing the video clip or directly click the Export button. Choose the file format, make settings-based changes like frame rate, bitrate, etc., and then press Export.

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w6CEhFHnII) to better understand how the speed adjustment and editing process work on Filmora.

## Conclusion

Facebook does not give the ability to change video speed for users. In this case, it is best to use different external solutions that you can install to make speed changes to the video. Browser extensions are useful for desktop users, while iOS and Android users can try apps.

However, it would be best to use third-party software like Filmora after downloading the video separately for superior-quality video speed changes. There are multiple speed settings, and each one is easy to use.

Try all the methods mentioned in this post and watch the video on Facebook at your preferred speed choice.
