### Import

Let's discuss how you can import your videos. So, first of all, you have to grant the VivaCut video editor permission to access your media gallery. Then you can import the videos as much as you want. However, there are a few limitations regarding it if you are using the free version: you can only export videos for up to five minutes.

### Primary Editing

So now, let's move forward using primary or essential editing tools in your videos. As we discussed earlier, you can use almost all the essential editing tools, whether using a free or a premium version. You can quickly get all these tools at the bottom of your mobile's screen. However, some features that need opening through the Canvas menu will not show. You can use these features in your videos by just clicking on them.

### Filters and AI effects

We will discuss how we can apply filters and AI effects to our videos using VivaCut. To use them in your videos, first of all, you have to click on the specific video on which you want to use them from the timeline. A menu will appear at the bottom of your mobile's screen from which you can click on the filters or AI effects option, whatever you want to use. In the free version, you have only access to the limited filters, and AI effects are not available. It would be best to upgrade your plan to get unlimited access to the AI effects and filter library.

### Chroma Key

Chroma Key is another excellent feature in the VivaCut video editor, which you can use to change your video's background easily. To use this feature in your videos, you must click on the video layer and select the Chroma key option from the menu at the bottom. You can also set up its settings according to your requirements from the menu. Also, this feature is available in both (free and premium) versions.
