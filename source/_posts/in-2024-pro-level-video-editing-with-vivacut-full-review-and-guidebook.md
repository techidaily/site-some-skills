## Part 1\. What is VivaCut Video Editor App?

### **Download:**

You can get the app from the app store by clicking the link below. The device supports the two most popular mobile operating systems: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.videoeditorpro.android&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)| [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vivacut-effect-video-editor/id1489090374)

### **Price:**

Even if you haven't bought any premium package, you can still use the VivaCut application and do simple editing for your videos. But the major con of using its free version is that it puts its watermark on the exported video, which may affect your video's look. To remove this watermark from your videos, you must purchase one of their premium packages (monthly or yearly). Moreover, if you want some more professional features, add INS or plugins and effects in it and remove the ads from it, you also have to purchase their premium version.
