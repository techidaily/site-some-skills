## Part 1\. What Is a Podcast Logo?

Before we get into how great podcast logos are made, let's look at the basics of a podcast logo. It's important not to get podcast logos mixed up with podcast artwork. Podcast artwork can warry for episodes or series and represents them individually.

Podcast logos usually stay the same and are a visual representation of all your work. Your podcast logo depicts your content to the viewer, illustrating what your channel is all about.

![serial killers podcast logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcasts-logos-1.jpg)

Above is an excellent example of a perfect podcast logo. Just looking at the picture sets the entire mood of the podcast. Users can easily comprehend the podcast's content from the logo, and interested users can get straight to listening.

### Where to use

You can think of your podcast logo as a representation of your brand. Your podcast logo will be visible on all your podcast covers. You can also use your logo on websites and when you market your products.
