Sign in the Audible App with your Amazon or Audible account information. When you go into the interface of the app, click on the "Channels" to see "browse all channels" in the "Featured Tab". As an Amazon Prime member, you can unlimited listen to Channels content, plus access to Prime-exclusive audiobook channels that feature full-length streaming audiobooks including best sellers, family favorites, celebrity-narrated classics, and more.

#### Kindle books with Audible narration

Prime members can find and borrow Audible book for free each month, but you cannot just download the audible book individually. You need to have the Kindle ebook at your account at first. You can either borrow it or purchase it. If the ebook has a matching audiobook, you can get the audible book for free via Amazon prime membership.

Note

* Prime members will have access to a rotating collection of 50 Audible audiobooks. You can listen to these audiobooks, but can not download it expect you have paid for them.

### Method 3\. Get Free Audible Books via Audible Account

As the biggest Audiobook producer, Audible.com offers many free audiobooks and podcasts for their listeners. You can just check the [audible free listens](https://www.audible.com/ep/FreeListens) webpage to purchase free audible books with $0.00.

### Method 4\. Get Free Audible Books via Special Celebrating Events

Every now and then, Audible.com will give some free audiobooks for some special days. On April 23, 2018, to celebrate the World Book Day, Audible is giving three audiobooks classics. In the [giveaway page for World Book Day](https://www.audible.com/ep/world-book-day), you will find the three free Audible audiobooks. You can see "All this week, we’re giving away great listens from legendary authors.". This makes me think they will give different titles during this whole weeks. If you are seeking for free classic audiobooks, make sure you bookmark this page and come to get your free audiobooks every day in their celebrating period.

### Method 5\. Get Free Audible Books & Audible Originals via Audible Membership

If you have already purchased the Audible membership and want to keep this membership, you can enjoy more than you can imagine, such as Audible channels and one free credit for exchanging the Audible books every month. These are not what I want to share here. A good news from Audible is that Audible members now can select 2 of 6 featured Audible Originals every month, in addition to 1 audiobook since September 2018\. But what is the Audible original? Audible Originals are exclusive audiobooks recorded by famous storytellers around the worlds. The audiobooks cover different areas, such as theater, journalism, literature and so on. You can check the 6 [featured Audible Original list](https://www.audible.com/ep/audible-originals-member-benefit) of this month to get your own two Audible Originals now.

Bonus Tips

All the audiobooks, free or non-free, downloaded from the Audible.com are all protected by Audible DRM. They are encoded in .aa or .aax audio formats which can only be played at some selected players. This is really annoying when we want to listen to Audible books in the car or when our mp3 players are not compatible with Audible audiobooks. You can use [**Epubor Audible Converter**](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/audible-converter/) to [convert AA, AAX audiobooks to mp3 or M4B](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). Why not give it a try to liberate your Audible books now?
