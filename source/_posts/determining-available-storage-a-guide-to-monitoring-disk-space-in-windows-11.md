 Sometimes it feels like you never have enough free disk space. Every app you install takes up valuable room on your main drive, and you might eventually run out. Here's how to check how much you have left.

##  Check Your Free Space Using File Explorer

 First, open File Explorer. To do so quickly, press Windows+E. Or click the folder icon in your taskbar if File Explorer is pinned there. You'll also find File Explorer in your Start menu.

 Click "This PC" in the left column. Under "Devices and Drives," you'll see your main system volume (C:) and any other drives in the computer. Windows shows the amount of free disk space on the drive directly below the drive's name.

##  Check Free Space in the Settings App

 To check how much free space you have using the Settings app, open the Settings app and navigate to System > Storage. Alternatively, search for "Storage" in the Start menu or taskbar search and click "Storage Settings."

![Search for 'storage,' then click 'Storage Settings.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-storage-settings.png) 

 Scroll down a bit in the Storage window and click "View Storage on Other Drives" under More Storage Settings. 

![Click 'View Storage on Other Drives.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4-view-storage.png)
