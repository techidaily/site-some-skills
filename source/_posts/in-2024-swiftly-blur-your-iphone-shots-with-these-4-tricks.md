## Swiftly Blur Your iPhone Shots with These 4 Tricks

While taking the images is merely the process of tapping the ‘Capture’ button, getting them from the correct angle and with proper lighting is an art. Because many smartphones nowadays offer the best picture quality when it comes to snapping photos using their camera, it is imperative to learn **how to blur a picture on iPhone** so the main subject grabs the limelight, hence making the other objects in the background get the least focus.

That said, when it is said **how to blur photos on iPhone**, it practically means that you are learning the process of blurring the background so the main subject (a person or an object) gets the most attention, and that’s what is explained in the following sections.

There are multiple ways to get this done. For instance, the background of the photos can be blurred while shooting even on the older iPhones. Likewise, if you already have an image, you can use the Photos app’s built-in effects, or download a third-party program to get the job done. Some of the common methods in this context are described below.

## Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone

Portrait mode in the Camera app is available on iPhone 7 Plus and above models. However, if you are using iPhone SE 2020 or iPhone XR, you can blur the background of the images only with the people as the main subject.

You can learn **how to blur an image on iPhone** using Portrait mode by following the instructions given below:

**Step 1: Launch the Camera App**

**Step 2: Get to the Portrait Mode and Adjust the Depth**

Swipe-drag the modes present above the **Shutter** button to switch to the **PORTRAIT** option, and tap the main subject on the screen that you want to capture the image of.

## Part 2: Take a Photo with a Blurred Background on Older iPhones by Getting Closer to the Subject

You can learn how to do this by following the steps given below:

**Step 1: Get to the Camera App**

Use the method explained above to launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone. Because it’s an old model that doesn’t have Portrait mode, you can stay in the **PHOTO** mode.

**Step 1: Get to the Photo’s Edit Mode**

Launch the **Photos** app on your iPhone, go to the album with the target photo, and tap to open the target photo. Next, make sure that the picture is not open in the full-screen mode, and tap **Edit** from the top-right corner to get to the **Edit** mode.

**Step 3: Save and Access the Photo**

Tap **Done** from the bottom-right corner to save the changes and to exit the **Edit** mode. Continue using the image as and/or where needed.

## Part 4: Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps

You may want to use a third-party app to apply effects to the photos because they offer several advanced features that the iPhone’s built-in Photos app doesn’t. Furthermore, since such programs are designed specifically for the purpose, they are quite intuitive and come with self-explanatory options and buttons.

There is a plethora of apps available on the App Store that can help you get the job done, and most of them come with their free tutorials to teach **how to blur photos on iPhone**. One such program is Snapseed that offers an easy way to pick the main subject in the image, and blur all the background objects behind it. The process of blurring the picture with Snapseed is given below:
