_**Subscriber Count: <17 million**_

TED or TED conference is a YouTube channel that promotes international content, whether on science, technology, culture, or academics. They invite the world's greatest minds to give their insight on a particular topic and tell a story to connect with a broader audience.

Videos on TED are usually posted daily; in this past month alone, they've shared more than 50 videos on their channel. What makes TED different is its story-driven narration. This is evident in their most viewed content, such as [Inside the mind of a master procrastinator - by Tim Urban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Benefit #1: Stories form a Deeper Human Connection

The main difference between the creators blowing on YouTube and the ones publishing a lot but not getting recognition is the story. YouTubers consistently put stories in their videos, allowing them to form a deeper human connection. Their viewers are educated and connected with that person, which is the reason for their success.

### Benefit #2: Stories help the Audience to Relate

A good story solves a problem and helps people to relate. Let's suppose you are doing a tech review. In this case, you definitely want to know what type of people are listening to you and how you can solve their problems.

Through story, your problem connects with theirs, and the audience starts relating with your content. This way, they won't be bombarded by facts and information and can immerse themselves as you talk about the tech gadget.

### Benefit #3: Stories Act as a Tool for Focus Retention

There is a ton of content on YouTube, making it easier for an average viewer to get overwhelmed. Storytelling eliminates this and lets you level up your content a little bit. Even if your videos are long, story-driven content keeps your viewers engaged and looking for more!
