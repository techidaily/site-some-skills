Due to its extensive feature set, it takes the top spot on our short list of the best cloud backup services. You receive 10GB of free storage space, which scales up to 10TB on paid plans; these plans are highly affordable compared to the amount of storage they offer.

**Official address**: <https://www.idrive.com/>

### No. 17\. LetsUpload

It is much more than most websites offer, whether 10 GB, 1 TB, or 100 TB. You can save an almost unlimited amount in your account, but you won't miss out on any extraordinary features. It enables you to stream media directly from your account, share files with anyone, set passwords for folders and files, send files via the built-in email feature, upload files by URL, and copy share links in bulk.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** the maximum upload size, when the account becomes dormant, ads, FTP and torrent uploads support, and the amount of time you must wait between downloads are some differences between a free and premium account.

A promising new addition to the list of the best free cloud storage providers available on the market today is Mimedia, which ranks among those providers. When you sign up for the Mimeda service, you receive 10 GB of **free cloud storage**. In its most basic form, it is a cloud-based backup service that assists you in organizing and managing the files that make up your collection. Users can access and organize files on their devices, including images, music, videos, and documents. Support for importing content from Facebook, Google, Dropbox, and Flickr is one of the most eye-catching features offered by Mimedia. Along with providing support for uploading any content to the cloud, the desktop app for Mimedia is easily compatible with both PC and Mac computers.

### No. 20\. CBackup

CBackup is an effective method to acquire free unlimited cloud backup storage. This **free cloud storage** can connect multiple cloud storage service accounts. You can merge all available storage in these accounts into a more immense combined cloud, such as 100 gigabytes or unlimited storage space to back up your data. It only takes a few minutes to back up or sync data from one cloud storage account to another, and you can do either of those things directly. Using CBackup will be more cost-effective than a minor expensive cloud storage service because it offers professional backup methods and standard backup features.

**Max free space:** 10GB
