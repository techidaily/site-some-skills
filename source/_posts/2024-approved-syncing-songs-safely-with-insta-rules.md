## Syncing Songs Safely with Insta Rules

Instagram is a popular social platform with over 2 billion monthly active users and is a great place to share your music and connect with new fans. However, before you start sharing your tunes, you must ensure you understand its music copyright rules.

In this article, we’ll give you a comprehensive guide to understanding **Instagram’s rules about copyright music.** We’ll also discuss a few tips for staying compliant and avoiding any potential copyright issues.

## How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?

Instagram has an automated system that generally detects copyrighted content in user posts, live shows, or IGTV. Even though the system is automated, mistakes can still occur; however, this wouldn’t stop the platform from taking down posts or videos entirely from user profiles.

Instagram's recently improved copyright infringement detection system now detects copyrighted music in content. The service sends a pop-up notification to the users, which gives them time to either stop using the track or change it in their posts.

Here’s what happens to your Instagram account if the system detects copyrighted content:

* Your post may be muted on Instagram.
* Instagram notifies you to take the track down if you're broadcasting a track during a Livestream.
* Instagram may take down your post entirely.

## Instagram Music Copyright Rules

Below are the three general copyright principles you should keep in mind when using music on Instagram:

* **Apply A Video When Sharing Music:** Instagram allows you to share a recording of an artist or band performing live and applying music to a short video.
* **Keep The Video Short:** Make sure your video is short because if you post a more extended clip with copyrighted music, Instagram’s detection system will limit your content.
* **Unlimited Music For Your Instagram Stories:** If you share a story on Instagram, the platform allows you to add unlimited copyrighted music to it from its built-in music library.

### (1) How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram

There are several workarounds for using **copyrighted music on Instagram:**

* **Collaborating With Artists Or Musicians:** Reach out to local musicians or new artists to see if you can collaborate and create custom sounds for your Instagram videos. Not only will you have copyright-free music that you can use, but you will also support independent artists!
* **Asking For Permission:** To avoid copyright issues on Instagram, you can contact the creator to seek permission before using their content.
* **Pay For The Copyrighted Music:** You can opt to pay for royalty-free music on your IG posts, live streams, or IGTV from various online libraries, such as [Pixaby,](https://pixabay.com/) [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/), and [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/).
* **Give Credit In Your Caption:** To use copyrighted music on your IG content, make sure to give credit to the original creator in your post’s caption.
* **Post Instagram Reel Videos:** Reels are short videos of about 15 seconds with a built-in music feature that applies a sticker to your content with the song's details and can save you from Instagram copyright music issues.

### (2) Using Filmora To Avoid Copyright Issue And Post Your Videos On Instagram

Copyright can be a tricky thing, especially when it comes to posting music videos on Instagram. However, there is a way to avoid any issues and still post your content on the platform.

### (3) Exceptions For Asking Permission To Use The Music

Here are some exceptions where you don’t need to ask for permission to use copyrighted music in your IG posts, reels, or Livestreams:

* **Using Your Own Music:** You have all the required rights to use your own music in your IG posts, Livestreams, or IGTV content.
* **Public Domain Songs:** Public Domain Songs are music with no official owner or official copyright protection and can be used however you want. You can find such soundtracks on the [Open Music Archive,](http://www.openmusicarchive.org/) [PD Info](https://www.pdinfo.com/), and [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/Main%5FPage) websites.

* **Royalty-Free Music:** It’s a type of music content where you have to give credit to the creator or pay some upfront for using their songs in your content. To learn more about this, [click here!](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)
* **Creative Commons Music Licensing**: Generally speaking, music in the Creative Commons still has some copyright protection. However, artists who publish under this license usually permit anyone to use their work for free. You can find CC-Music Licensing content on [TakeTones.](https://taketones.com/track/experience)

## Common Questions About Copyright Music On Instagram

Below, you’ll find answers to common questions Instagram users ask about copyrighted music.

### Does Instagram Have Its Own Copyright Music?

Yes, Instagram offers a comprehensive library of royalty-free music you can use on your Stories and Reels. Simply click the “**Music**” icon while editing your post and find the soundtrack you want to add. This will, however, add a music sticker to your content.

### Can I Use Copyright Music On Instagram Stories?

Yes, you can use Live or recorded performances and music from the catalog in your IG Stories.

### Can You Play Music On Instagram Live?

There are some conditions to playing music on your Instagram Live. For instance, you can stream live artists' performances, play your own music, or add royalty-free soundtracks.

### Can I Use 30 Seconds Of Copyright Music On Instagram?

Unfortunately, there's no simple rule on Instagram that says using 5, 15, or 30 seconds of a song is always an acceptable use. So using 30 seconds of copyrighted music on Instagram is not considered a safe bet.

## What Do You Do When Instagram Blocks Your Video?

Since Instagram uses an automated copyright detection system, your content might get blocked, muted, or removed. To avoid this from happening, you can place an appeal on the platform by following these steps:

Step1 From the notification menu, click the copyright issue message, and you will be provided details of who reported your content and why.

If the original creator has reported you, their details will be displayed along with the reason.

Step2 Read the notice that says you have permission to share the content in the video and tap the **“I agree”** option.

![making appeal on instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copyright-music-on-instagram-4.jpg)

Step3 Tap the **“Appeal”** button. You can anticipate a decision within 24 hours. If you have adhered to the rules and possess the authority to use copyrighted music in your content, Instagram should lift all limitations.
