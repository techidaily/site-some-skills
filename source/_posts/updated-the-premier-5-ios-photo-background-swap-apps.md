This photo background remover app allows you to have fun with your photos because it provides powerful tools that even a child can use. The app lets you zoom in to the pixel level, which allows you to have more precision while you are removing the background of the photo. The Magic Wand tool removes the same color areas of a photo automatically, and the app offers a wide range of brushes that goes from very soft to hard. Magic Eraser allows you to save high-resolution images without a watermark in PNG or JPEG file formats.

#### 5\. [Cut Paste Photo, Background](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cut-paste-photo-background/id1192981123?mt=8)
