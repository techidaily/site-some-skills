If you are an eBook lover, I guess you may often purchase eBooks online. But the fact that books we purchased from the main eBook stores, such as Amazon, Kobo and Barnes & Noble are always protected by DRM. If we only have a particular device such as a Kindle, we can only read downloaded Kindle books via it. However, if we download DRM free eBooks, even the formats are not supported, we can use the eBook converter to convert the formats without DRM limitation. But how to find DRM free eBooks? Where can we download or buy DRM free books? Don't worry. I have searched online, found some useful websites sell DRM free books and want to share them with you. Hope you can find the one you like. 

#### 1 Smashwords  

[Smashwords](http://www.smashwords.com/) sells eBooks from independent authors and publishers. It provides us a massive library of DRM free eBooks in multiple formats, including PDF, EPUB, Mobi, etc for reading on any devices. Here we can find all kinds of categories books, including fiction or nonfiction.

Another reason that I recommend this website is that it offers us a plenty of free eBooks, we can download our favorite books without any cost.

It sells eBooks from both Baen and other publishers, including Del Rey, Tor Books, Blindsided Books, etc. It also offers us some free eBooks in their "Free Library".

#### 4 LuLu

[LuLu](http://www.lulu.com/shop) is a self-publishing and distribution platform. We can not only purchase books here, but also sell or create our own books.

In June 27, 2012 Infound a statement written on the pack box of a Kleennrx tissues said " Keenex facial tissues made from wood fibers sourced from sustainably managed eucalypt and pine plantations". This matter droven me to made more researchs, and to my surprise, I found out that there sre more than 75,000 trees cut down every year in the plant for wood manufacturing including furniture and books!. I stopped purchasing paper books since then, and converting my newspapers and books to e-reading.
