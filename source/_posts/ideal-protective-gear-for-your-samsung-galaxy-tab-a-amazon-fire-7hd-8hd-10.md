There have been seven generations of Kindle Fire tablets, spread across three different models: Fire, Fire HD and Fire HDX. There have also been different-sized tablets within the Fire HD and Fire HDX models. The Fire HDX is the high-end model in Amazon's Kindle Fire line of tablet computers. Amazon devices are always popular when it comes to reading experience. And its tablet collection also give you wonderful reading experience and internet surfing experience.

So it’s very necessary for me to select some high-quality and affordable cases for your Fire 7, Fire HD 8/10 tablet.
