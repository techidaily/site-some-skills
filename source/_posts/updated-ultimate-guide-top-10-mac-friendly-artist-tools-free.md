## Ultimate Guide: Top 10 Mac-Friendly Artist Tools (Free)

When it comes to flawless functioning, especially in graphics designing, animations, and most importantly, during the rendering process, nothing can beat the smoothness and speed of a Mac computer. With that said, if you are a creative designer, you would hate the frequent system crashes that Windows PCs have, and most certainly, you wouldn’t like the time the non-Mac computers waste when your head is full of the creative idea.

Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some **free drawing software for Mac** that you can use as a beginner or a professional graphic designer.

## Part 1: 10 Best Drawing Apps for Mac \[Free & Paid\]

Below are some **best drawing programs for Mac, free** and paid. The list also includes the name of a built-in app in macOS called Preview that is more or less similar to MS Paint that Windows operating systems have.

It is noteworthy that the applications listed below are in no particular order as far as their working efficiency or flexibility is concerned, and you are free to pick any software that you find best as per your business or personal needs.

Although we have tried our best to provide the latest information about the programs available in this writing, you are highly encouraged to check the vendors’ official websites to get the most updated version and corresponding details of the applications you are interested in.
