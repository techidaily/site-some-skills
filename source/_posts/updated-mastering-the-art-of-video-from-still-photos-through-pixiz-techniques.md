So, Pixiz is an excellent service to make photo videos online by just uploading photos and clicking to generate. But there aren't many ways to customize it. Additionally, there are a lot of problems with the commercials, the little selection of templates, and the brief movie length. On the other hand, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) offers more advanced tools than Pixiz online slideshow maker to create more attractive and advanced slideshows or photo videos. However, you must buy the premium version to unlock its full potential and remove the watermark. I hope you'll find this article helpful. Thanks for Reading!
