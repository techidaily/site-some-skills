## Simplify Shopping with Amazon's Innovative Groceboard Subscription Service!

Buying your groceries online is probably an increasingly popular option. Even as online purchases became popular, people still liked going into supermarkets and grabbing groceries themselves. While that hasn't changed, you can also just have your groceries delivered to your doorstep. Amazon has just added a subscription that'll be perfect for you if you're in the latter camp.

 Amazon has introduced a new unlimited grocery delivery subscription available to [Prime members](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/deactivating-your-androids-facebook-feature-easy-instructions-inside/) and those with an EBT card in eligible U.S. locations, encompassing 3,500 cities and towns. The service, following successful tests in Denver, Sacramento, and Columbus, will be costing $9.99 per month for Prime users and $4.99 for EBT cardholders. If you subscribe to this, you will benefit from free delivery on grocery orders exceeding $35 from Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and local retailers like Cardenas Markets, Save Mart, and Bartell Drugs.

 The subscription will give you one-hour delivery windows for your orders at no extra charge, unlimited 30-minute pickups for any order size, and priority access to weekly grocery deliveries. A 30-day free trial is provided before payment initiation. Amazon says that the subscription "pays for itself" even with a single monthly order under $50 from Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods Market. Deliveries cost money otherwise—orders between $50 and $100 from Whole Foods/Amazon Fresh incur a service fee of $6.95 and $9.95 for orders under $50—so this is pretty on point.

 This initiative competes with Walmart Plus, priced at $12.95 per month or $98 annually, and Target's $99 yearly grocery delivery service, both sharing Amazon's $35 minimum order threshold. While Amazon's plan extends broader retailer partnerships, including specialty stores like Pet Food Express and Mission Wine & Spirit, Walmart Plus and Target offer similar convenience at slightly different price points.

 If you want to check out this subscription, it's [now live on Amazon's website](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJ9DGD6N/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002824&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Famazon-grocery-subscription-2024%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), so make sure to check it out. It's an extra subscription on top of your regular Amazon Prime subscription. Also, keep in mind that you need to live in one of the 3,500 eligible locations if you want those sweet free grocery deliveries.
