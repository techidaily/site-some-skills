## Part 3: Tips on Using macOS 11 Big Sur

Got a clear-cut view regarding **Big Sur requirements**? Once updated, the chances might seem overwhelming at first glance and challenging to sort out things. Now, it's time to view some tips and tricks on using macOS Big Sur to experience a little better experience.

**#1 Place control center to the menu bar**

To find Wi-Fi options, display adjustments in iPhone and iPad are easy and are finally accessible in macOS Big Sur. Yes, the new Big Sur Mac has an adorable control center that pop-ups immediately. With options like Bluetooth, volume, screen brightness, Wi-Fi, and AirDrop, drag it from the control panel and place it on the menu bar.

**#2 Resize widgets from the notification center**

The macOS 11 Big Sur comes with the customizable widget feature to resize them right from the notification center. Offering three different sizes like small, medium, and large, to do this, open the notification center, right-click the widget, and choose a size option.

**#3 Disable/turn off automatic AirPods switching**

Apple introduced the new AirPods automatic switching feature that establishes a connection between Apple devices when the audio is playing. For instance, if your iPhone is connected, but a YouTube video is about to play on your Mac, the AirPods will switch to the Mac mechanically.

**#4 Quicker handling of notifications**

Never want your screen or notification screen to be crowded by stacked by app notifications? Like how the reports are dealt with in iOS and iPad, Big Sur also offers a reliable way to manage the notifications effectively and directly for easy navigation.

**#5 Upgrade to Memojis from Mac**

Once limited to the iMessaging app of iPhone and iPad, the messaging app in macOS 11 Big Sur is dramatically better. You can make use of Memojis and GIFs too at present. Yes, right from your Mac, you can send personalized Memojis to others.

## Bonus Tip: The Best Video Editor for macOS 11 Big Sur

Is Filmora the best [macOS editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to perform keyframing? Yes, it is with the editable preset option and not just keyframing, but motion tracking, social media upload, and still a lot more is hidden within to be explored by you!

* Add fun to your creation with simple drag-and-drop creative transitions, motion elements, filters, and titles.
* Create unique looks with special effects like layer media or blending modes.
