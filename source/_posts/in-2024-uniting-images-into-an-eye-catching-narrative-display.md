It has come a long way from printed form and is now scalability in the digital space. Currently, photomontage-making tools are available for quick mounting.

## What is a photomontage?

Unlike the typical photograph with a single pic, a photomontage encompasses several photos collaged together. It doesnâ€™t matter the number of photos it contains. You can also use a variety of locations to take photos. Way back, photographers composed photo montage images by cutting, gluing, and arranging pieces together. However, the advent of computers has shifted the dimension of making a photo montage. Several apps are available for not only montaging your photos, but also editing them for a splendid outcome.

## Things to pay attention to before making a PhotoMontage

Letâ€™s check out what to consider in the quest to make a photo montage.

### i) Whatâ€™s your subject?

Ask yourself what you intend to express with your photomontage. Pick a subject thatâ€™s static and simple. You should also consider the ease of adding more photos if you need to. Plan out how many photos you want to include in your montage as well.

### ii) Keep it real

Donâ€™t exaggerate your work, but keep it real. At a glance, related collage photos will make sense. Likewise, check the photos you are importing into your editing program. Itâ€™s great to use easily editable clips.
