### **Why we need to convert Kobo books to Kindle?**

Before we convert Kobo books to Kindle, let's learn about Kobo and Kindle supported formats. Then we can figure out why we need to convert the eBooks formats.

**Kindle formats:** All the Kindle devices including Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Touch, Kindle Voyage and Kindle Fire(HD) only support Amazon unique formats, such as Mobi, AZW, AZW3, PRC, Topaz, etc. 

**Kobo formats:** Kobo books are always with common EPUB, PDF and Kepub formats. This makes Kobo books are not compatible with Kindle devices.

 As Kobo and Kindle support different eBooks formats, in order to read Kobo books on Kindle, we need to convert Kobo books to Kindle formats first.  

### How to convert Kobo books to Kindle?

Usually, when we purchase or download Kobo books, we will get different Kobo formats, such as EPUB, Kepub and ACSM. It depends on where and how we get them.

#### 1 Remove DRM from Kobo eBooks (EPUB, Kepub, ACSM)

Books we purchase from Kobo online eBooks store are always with Adobe DRM protection. It locks us only can read Kobo books on its specific reading app or devices, such as Kobo Desktop, Kobo glo. We can not convert eBooks format unless we remove their DRM. So, removing Adobe DRM is needed first.

**Tools you will need:** 

**1\. [Epubor Ultimate Converter:](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)**

Adobe Digital Editions can read your DRM-protected EPUB and PDF books. This makes Epubor Ultimate Converter find the key to decrypt protected books.

Kobo books are always with Adobe DRM. Here we can divide it into 2 situations.

Case 1  Remove DRM from Kobo Kepub files

**For Kobo Kepub files syned via Kobo desktop**

**Step 1:** Install Kobo Desktop and sync your Kobo books.

Run Kobo Desktop and login in it with your own Kobo account. Click "Library", it will synced all your purchased books which will be with Kepub format and are Adobe DRM-protected.
