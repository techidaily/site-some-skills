## Part I: What is Edgenuity?

Edgenuity is an e-learning platform that provides students with a linear preparation model. Several colleges, universities, and high schools in the United States have used it to supplement their curricula. This platform assists students with their academic work.

It provides students various services and content, such as course outlines, essay questions, research guidebooks, and much more. Let's look at the necessary skills and how to bypass the Edgenuity videos below.

## Part II. When will the students want to skip videos on Edgenuity?

Keeping people interested in a video they've already seen takes time and effort. It's even more difficult to keep people entertained when they know they'll be bored by the end of the videoâ€”as is the case with educational videos.

Moreover, they lack genuine content. Most of the time, a teacher will tell you what to do for your homework and then hand you an assignment sheet with it written down.

![long educational videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/long-educational-videos.jpg)

When students are confused about the material, they will look for shortcuts. The best way to deal with this is to provide them multiple opportunities to learn each concept. Students will also want to skip the videos when there is too much text or questions on the same topic and if they are bored, distracted, or do not care about the content.

Students should be engaged by the material shown when watching educational videos. They should be able to comprehend the material and apply it to their own lives.

1. Speeding up the lecture using the chrome browser.

### The perks of using videos within the classroom for teachers

**Allow students to participate in the production.**

Videos provide an excellent model for learner output, letting students create their version of the original. The immersive experience factor is brilliant, and students can create their version in the classroom.

**Power up activities**

You can provide stimulation for classroom activities by using videos. It will allow you to manipulate students' desire to learn new things while providing exceptional value for the entire learning experience.

**More information is provided by video.**

There's no doubt that videos are rich in information. Besides, they present the information in an easy-to-digest, entertaining manner that you will appreciate and enjoy. That alone improves the learning experience significantly.

**Engage students**

Learners are known to be involved and immersed in videos. Video is permitted for an immersive and engaging learning experience and should be used in the classroom as soon as possible.

### How To Make Videos Students Would Not Want to Skip?

Videos have aided educators in teaching, especially in the Covid-19 pandemic era. And once the pandemic is done, videos will not likely leave the classrooms. Many people are visual learners, and videos provide a way to absorb better the information they learn. But people would only want to watch a video if it's interesting. So, students may not watch the videos educators present to them.

What if videos students need to watch are not "boring?" They would want to see the whole thing. Therefore, tools that help make videos compelling are educators' best allies. And what would those tools be other than powerful video editing software?

There are plenty of options, but Wondershare Filmora is by far the best. It is a powerhouse when it comes to video editing, with a delightfully interactive layout that enables anyone to become an excellent video editor. Using its many handy features is a surefire way to grab the viewer's full attention. So, students would want to keep their eyes focused on the screen, even if they already know what the video tries to teach them. And that, right there, is how you can make videos an effective learning tool.

### Features on Filmora Teachers Could Use to Improve Educational Videos

**Text to Speech**

Text-to-speech technology lets machines read text aloud with natural-sounding voices. Educators can use this to add narration to educational videos. That helps explain the lessons better.

Type a narration and add it to the parts of the video where they are needed. Then, use text-to-speech.

**Screen Recorder**

The screen recorder feature is handy for lessons that need a lot of explaining or demonstration. It will let you convert the Paint app or another app into a digital whiteboard.

![screen recording software for teachers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/screen-recording-software-teachers.jpg)

One example is when teaching students how blood circulates. How does blood enter the heart, and how does it exit it? You can screen record a video of you explaining that through drawing arrows in an app.

**Split Screen**

You can utilize the split screen feature when teaching the differences between things. Use one screen to show one of the subjects and one for the thing you are comparing it with. For example, on one screen, you can show how Reykjavik, Iceland looks at 8 pm. On the other screen, show what it looks like at Reykjavik's antipodal point at the same time.

![split screen video for education](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/split-screen-video-education.jpg)

These are only some tools you can use to leverage Filmora for teaching. With Filmora, It is simple to use and supports various formats, including MP4, AVI, AVCHD, and many others. Using various fashion filters and visual effects, you can add Mosaic, tilt shift, and effects like face-off to your video. Here's a [link](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to the list of features this video editor offers. With resourcefulness, you will surely find a tool you can use to explain your lessons better more creatively. And with that, your students would not be looking for a skip button.

_You can also watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtka%5FQjtfcE)_ to get a quick start with Filmora.

## Conclusion

Edgenuity is a great learning program. Not having a skip button makes it, so students must watch the entire videos and learn from them. But as they say, "if there's a will, there's a way." So, students found workarounds so they could skip videos. Making educational videos more entertaining could stop them from doing so. And an excellent video editing tool is key to that. Wondershare Filmora is among the best options, as its toolkit is filled with features educators can utilize.
