* If the Windows key is causing interruptions during your gaming session, you can disable it through the Registry Editor, Local Group Policy Editor, Microsoft PowerToys, or by using your keyboard software.
* You can use Microsoft PowerToys or AutoHotkey to disable the ALT+Tab shortcut on Windows.

 Windows is designed for general computer use, not specifically for gaming. The Windows key, Alt+Tab, and other keyboard shortcuts like Sticky Keys can pull you out of full-screen games and bring you back to the desktop. Luckily, it's very easy to disable them, so you can enjoy uninterrupted gaming sessions.

##  How to Disable the Windows Key

 There are a couple of methods by which you can disable the Windows key on your Windows PC. Let's check out all the methods in detail:

###  Using the Registry Editor

 One of the best ways to disable the Windows key on your computer is by using the Registry Editor. However, before you begin, it's important to [back up the registry](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/quick-start-guide-dells-simple-screen-recording-methods-for-2024/) and [create a restore point](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-multiplying-joy-sharing-a-pile-of-photos-and-videos-with-instagram/). This will ensure that your data remains safe even if something goes wrong during the editing process.

 With that said, open the Start menu, type **Registry Editor** in the search bar, and press Enter.

 In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following location:

        `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout`
    
 Right-click the "Keyboard Layout" key, select "New," and choose "Binary Value." Then, name the value "Scancode Map."

![Scancode Map binary value in the Registry Editor.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/scancode-map-binary-value-in-the-registry-editor-1.jpg) 

 Right-click on the "Scancode Map" value and select "Modify."

![Modify option for the Scancode binary value.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/modify-option-for-the-scancode-binary-value.jpg) 

 Type the following value in the "Value Data" field and click "OK."

        `00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00  
03, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 5B, E0,  
00, 00, 5C, E0, 00, 00, 00, 00`
    
![Edit Binary Value window in the Registry Editor.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/edit-binary-value-window-in-the-registry-editor.jpg) 

 Afterward, [restart your computer](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-15-must-use-hashtags-for-popularity-on-instagram-feed/), and you'll find that the Windows key is no longer functioning. To re-enable the Windows key in the future, simply delete the "Scancode Map" binary value from the Registry Editor, and the Windows key will start working again.

###  Using the Local Group Policy Editor

 If you have Windows Pro or Enterprise edition, you can use the Local Group Policy Editor to disable the Windows key on your computer. To do this, [open the Local Group Policy Editor](https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-first-steps-in-the-youtubian-economy-building-a-brand-boosting-bank-balance/) and navigate to the following location:

        `User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > File Explorer`
    
 In the right pane, double-click the "Turn Off Windows Key Hotkeys" policy.

![Turn Off Windows Key Hotkeys policy in the Local Group Policy Editor.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/turn-off-windows-key-hotkeys-policy-in-the-local-group-policy-editor.jpg)

![Enable option  in the Local Group Policy Editor.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/enable-option-in-the-local-group-policy-editor.jpg) 

 Then, restart your computer to see the changes. If you want to re-enable the Windows key, you'll need to configure the "Turn Off Windows Key Hotkeys" policy to "Disabled" or "Not Configured."

###  Using Microsoft PowerToys

[Microsoft PowerToys](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-auto-play-youtube-iphoneandroid-no-notification/) is a free app from Microsoft that lets you [disable keys on your Windows PC](https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-adobe-premiere-pro-on-mac/). To use it to disable the Windows key, first [install it from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XP89DCGQ3K6VLD?ocid=pdpshare) and then open it.

 In the left sidebar, select "Keyboard Manager" and then click on "Remap a Key" in the right pane.

![Remap a Key option in PowerToys.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/remap-a-key-option-in-powertoys.jpg) 

 Choose "Add Key Remapping."

 Click the "Select" button, and then press the "Windows" key on your keyboard. Click "OK" after selecting the key.

![Selecting Windows key in PowerToys.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/selecting-windows-key-in-powertoys-1.jpg) 

 From the "To Send" drop-down menu, choose "Disable."

 When you want to start using the Windows key again, simply click the trash icon next to the key.

![Trash icon on PowerToys](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/trash-icon-on-powertoys-1.jpg) 

###  Using Your Keyboard Software

 If you have a [gaming keyboard](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-12-prominent-oppo-fingerprint-not-working-solutions-by-drfone-android/), it likely has dedicated software that lets you configure how the keys work. Most gaming keyboards also have a gaming mode that, when enabled, disables keys that might interrupt your gaming session, including the Windows key.

 For example, if you have an Alienware keyboard, you can use the Fn+F6 key combination to enable gaming mode. If you're unaware of the key combination for your keyboard, check the user manual for more information.

##  How to Disable the Alt+Tab Shortcut

 Pressing Alt+Tab opens the app switcher, which lets you see and switch between different programs running on your computer. However, you might not want to hit this key combination during an intense gaming session because it will minimize your game. You can prevent this from happening by temporarily disabling this shortcut.

###  Using Microsoft PowerToys

 Similar to disabling the Windows key, you can also use Microsoft PowerToys to turn off the Alt+Tab shortcut. To do this, open Microsoft PowerToys, go to "Keyboard Manager," select "Remap a Shortcut," and then click "Add Shortcut Remapping."

###  Using AutoHotKey

 AutoHotkey is a popular third-party tool that helps you manage keyboard shortcuts on your Windows computer. It allows you to disable specific keys or key combinations. To use it to disable the Alt+Tab shortcut, first, [download and install AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) on your computer. Then, right-click anywhere on your desktop, select "New," and then "AutoHotkey Script."

![AutoHotkey Script option in context menu.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/autohotkey-script-option-in-context-menu.jpg) 

 Give a name to the script file and press Enter.

 Right-click on the newly created script file, choose "Open With," and select "Notepad."

![Open with Notepad option.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/open-with-notepad-option.jpg) 

 Clear any default text in the Notepad document, paste the following codes and press Ctrl+S to save the changes.

        `#=::Return  
  
; Disable Alt+Tab  
!Tab::Return`
    
![Code in Notepad.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/code-in-notepad.jpg)
