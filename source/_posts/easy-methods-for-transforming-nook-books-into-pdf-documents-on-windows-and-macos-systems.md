Except Amazon and Kobo the 2 main eBook retailers, Barnes & Noble also shares a part of eBook market. For eBook lovers, sometimes, we simply just found an eBook we love very much, while it's not sold on Kobo or Amazon eBook store, but Nook. We purchase it and want to read it on more portable devices or platform we like without any limitation. Obviously, PDF is a more accessible format. Therefore, we may need to convert Nook to PDF. But how can we convert Nook books to PDF files? Don't worry! This is exactly I will talk about in this article. You can learn about an excellent Nook to PDF converter and how to convert for details here.

To convert Nook to PDF, just follow the below steps:

1. Install and set up Android Studio on your PC/Mac.
2. Download Nook books via Nook for Android App.
