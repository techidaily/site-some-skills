## Part 1\. Why Solo Podcasting?

![solo podcasting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-1.jpg)

Solo podcasting is all about the personal connection with listeners. It's a chance to express yourself, a platform to share your ideas and thoughts with people. Also, to show people who you are and what you're about—the beauty of solo podcasting. You are free, and it's a great feeling. The idea is simple: You are the protagonist of your own story.

### Go at your own pace

Working on your own gives flexibility with working hours you wouldn't get as part of a team. That means you can work at your own pace and not feel pressured by a deadline or fear failing since knowing no one but yourself is listening.

It also means you can work at your own pace as a podcast host without waiting for your audience to be ready.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Content is totally under your control

You're always controlling your content while working in a solo podcaster scenario. No one else tells you what to say; no one tells you how to say it.

The upside is that you don't have to worry about getting your ideas "out there," which allows you to be creative.No but yourself can dictate the tone of your show.

Solo podcasters don't have anyone else to compete with, and they get to choose what they talk about. You're in full control over everything, which means no advertisers or sponsors are dictating your message.

That means you can ensure that you deliver a compelling story that people want to hear.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Post-Production is Easier

When you work alone, you can take time to make changes or re-edits. Post-production is also easier to deal with if you don't have the pressure to deliver something at a certain time.

### Connect with Your Audience on a Deeper Level

Solo podcasting is one of the most efficient ways to build relationships with your audience and connect with them deeper.

When you're just starting, your audiences don't know who you are. So you'll likely struggle to connect with them on a personal level. But By developing a solo podcast, you allow yourself to develop a personal brand while building a network of people who share your same passion and interests.

Keep your content focused on your unique story, and be as transparent as possible when you get started. Most listeners prefer to connect with the hosts they find on podcasts than on other media, And Solo Podcast listeners trust their hosts as experts on their topics.

## Part 2\. How to Make a Bang-Up Solo Podcast

Now, we are going to look into the ins and outs of creating a Bang-Up Solo Podcast that would grab your viewers' maximum attention. But first, we must share something interesting in a way that they understand, And this is what will make your podcast an excellent solo podcast.

### A list of solo episode topics

First, while working on the episode, we must remember that connecting audience with your subject matters.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![podcast episode list to talk about](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-2.jpg)

For example, if you're a musician who wants to share insights on improving your songwriting craft, you may need to focus on it. Secondly, before creating an episode, our Listeners may want to hear the story behind the product, so it's helpful to explain why you built it, what your goals were, what you learned, what you got done, and how the product has evolved.

It will help you give clear instructions for deciding on solo episode topics that are creative, unique, helpful & engaging to share.

### An outline for an episode

One common mistake when creating a podcast is jumping into it without a plan. Therefore it's important to have some roadmap for your episode before you even begin working on it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![podcast outline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-3.jpg)

An outline for a good episode usually includes an introduction/promo, the main topic, a break, a conclusion, and a wrap-up. It helps you understand the topic you want to cover.

If you don't have a clear idea of what you want to talk about, you will have trouble following along when you sit down to record. Just be careful not to repeat yourself too much. Don't try and cover every single aspect of your topic.

### A hook for the episode beginning

The hook is the first thing that draws the listener in and sets up the rest of the content. What is it about your show that makes people want to listen? Your hook should always be unique, but a little commonality doesn't hurt.

If you're struggling to come up with a hook for an episode of your podcast, here are a few ideas for you to consider:

* What topic do you enjoy talking about?
* What do you want to learn about?
* Is there something, in particular, you're interested in?

### Mind the length of your solo podcast

Length is everything. Podcasting is about the length of your content, and you will struggle if you have a short episode. You need at least 30 minutes of material for your episode, or you risk alienating listeners and driving them away from your brand.

You'll lose listeners' attention if you don't know what to say during your episode. So instead, think of your podcast as a mini-publication. You can get away with making shorter episodes because you can fill more content into your episodes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Recap the episode

Recapping the previous episode is a great way to start your podcast. Doing so allows your listeners to quickly catch up while at the same time giving you a chance to share the most relevant information from the last show.

That way, when the next podcast episode starts, your listeners will already be up-to-date on essential information.

## Part 3\. Tips & Takeaways for Solo Podcasting

The world of podcasts is changing, so how can podcasters succeed when there's so much competition? We asked three podcasters how to get started, who have grown as solo podcasters. Here are their top tips and lessons, plus advice from fellow podcasters.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Don't worry about mistakes

The first tip for solo podcasters is to not worry about making mistakes. We all make mistakes. And when we do, we learn. So don't stress out over your first podcast. Instead, take notes after each episode and use those as your learning curve. You don't need to be perfect from the very beginning.

### Practice

It takes some practice to get the natural flow of conversation going. We recommend practicing speaking in front of a mirror to ensure you sound confident and natural. Once you've practiced enough, record yourself, listen back, and play it to see where you're strong and where you need to improve.

### Stand a point

A key part of being a successful podcast host is sticking to your bullet points. While the show is running, there's no time for you to ramble, so your goal is to make sure you hit all your points and move on quickly.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Have fun

Having fun doesn't mean that you're doing something wrong. But it does mean relaxing. You're doing something right. People are more likely to listen if they know you're having fun while you talk. On the other hand, if you take yourself too seriously, people will tune out.

## Part 4\. The challenges of making solo podcasting

If you're working on a podcast as a solo podcast host, you need to figure out where to find guests, approach them, and create a rapport with your listeners. The challenges of making solo podcasting are many. Whether you make music or talk about your favourite hobby or sport, someone is likely there who can help you.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://cowinaudio.pxf.io/c/5597632/1116855/13794" target="_top" id="1116855"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13794-1116855" border="0" alt="" width="767" height="285"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1116855/13794" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### No one to share the workload

There's no denying it, being a solo podcast host is hard work. There's no one to take over if you fall behind schedule or have a day off. Being a solo podcast host takes a lot of time and energy, and you don't get a choice.

Even if you manage to pull it off, some people don't like your podcast and have nothing but negative things to say about you. Preparing for this every time you create a new episode would be best. Therefore You need to have someone to take over when you fall.

### Harder to stay motivated

The problem with solo podcasts is that there is no built-in motivation. You must do it because you enjoy it or hope it will help someone else. There's no intrinsic reason to do it. That said, the biggest problem with making solo podcasts is that it becomes harder and harder to stay motivated to keep making episodes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Harder to deliver a Montage

If your podcast is mostly monologue or narration, and you don't do any interviews or interviews with yourself, you will feel like a hamster in a wheel with no release.

To deliver a montage effectively, you must first create a soundtrack of voiceover audio in your mind. It would be best to hear it repeatedly until you've committed the track to memory. Once you have that, you must record the monologue audio and edit it into a montage.

Systems expert, permission giver, and author, Kendra Adachi, is the solo host of the podcast 'The Lazy Genius.' It helps you be a genius about the things that matter and lazy about the things that don't.

Kendra listeners get great, practical advice in a friendly and relatable way. In addition, the episodes are a manageable length, which means you can listen to them quickly or put them in a queue if you're listening.

### 10\. [Say Your Mind](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/say-your-mind/id1324118843)

![say your mind cover](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-14.jpg)

A great comedian with some serious insights into astrology and Tarot cards, Kelechi Okafor, takes you on a wild journey around the world of bad language, current events, and pop culture.

Kelechi, with a great mind, teaches and guides her listeners to lean into their inner selves while boldly speaking on world events others seek to avoid. She mixes humor with the truth and commentary on current affairs/pop culture.

## Final words

It's important to note here that while podcasting has been around for quite some time, the "Solo" style, which focuses on the creative process and inspiration behind the creation of a podcast, is relatively new.

If you're planning to do a solo podcast, you need to create a clear outline of what you want to cover, your goals, and what you expect from the podcast. Remember, a good podcast takes time and effort to produce, so make sure you put in the necessary time and effort to get the best results.
