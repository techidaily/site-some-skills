## Expand Your Amazon Prime Experience with the Integration of Grubhub+

Amazon has made sure that its Prime subscription is a must have in our lives. Not only does it give you free shipping on one of the world's largest online retailers, but it also gives you a slew of other perks ranging from streaming services to even credit cards. Now, yet another perk is joining the fray, as Amazon has announced that its Prime subscription will be getting you nothing other than a GrubHub+ subscription.

 Amazon Prime members in the U.S. now have access to free Grubhub+ membership and can order food directly through Amazon.com or the Amazon Shopping app. This partnership adds a lot more value to the Prime membership you already have while also being extremely convenient, as it means that you can now order from hundreds of thousands of restaurants nationwide without leaving the Amazon platform.

 The Grubhub+ membership is valued at $120 annually and offers benefits such as $0 delivery fees on eligible orders over $12, reduced service fees, 5% credit back on pick-up orders, and exclusive offers. By bundling it with your Amazon Prime subscription, which is about $16 a month, you're saving a whopping $10 per month compared to what you'd pay if you paid for both subscriptions separately.

 This is not the first time the perk has been offered. Prime members have already saved a lot of money since the [Grubhub+ offer began in 2022](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-most-effective-methods-to-unlock-apple-iphone-se-2020-in-lost-mode-by-drfone-ios/), with frequent users saving an average of $300 per year. It was brought back because it's a fan favorite, but it's not immediately clear whether it's staying in the long run or if this is a limited time offer—neither Amazon's announcement post nor the company's info website gives us any info about that, so it's probably safe to assume that it's at least staying for a few months. In addition to the ongoing Grubhub+ benefits, Prime members can save an extra $5 on orders over $25 placed through Amazon by June 2nd using the code "PRIME5".

 If you want to check it out, make sure to check out [Amazon's Grubhub page](https://www.amazon.com/prime/offer/embedded/grubhub/prime-deal?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003415&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Famazon-prime-now-includes-grubhub-plus%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) to know more and to claim the offer.
