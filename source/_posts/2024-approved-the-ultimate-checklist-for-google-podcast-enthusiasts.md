##### Promote on social media

Share your podcast on social media platforms and encourage your audience to share it with their networks. It can increase your visibility and attract more subscribers.

##### Engage

### 3.A fancy cover matters

The first thing that will attract listeners is your podcast's cover art. It can improve the credibility of your podcast and encourage listeners to give it a try. It is just like how a movie or a book with good cover art seems more appealing.

Regardless of what platform you are uploading your podcast on. The cover cart is the key to standing out from the crowd. Unfortunately, different platforms have their own size specifications for cover art. Let's see the requirements for Google Podcasts:
