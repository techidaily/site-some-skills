Ready to elevate your Windows experience without relying on the cloud? Here’s how to get started with LM Studio.</p><h2 id="LM-Studio-Is-Your-New-AI-Playground"><a href="#LM-Studio-Is-Your-New-AI-Playground" class="headerlink" title="LM Studio Is Your New AI Playground"></a>LM Studio Is Your New AI Playground</h2><p> You might already be familiar with popular AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, or Microsoft’s Copilot. LM Studio is another powerful tool, that runs right on your Windows PC, without needing a remote server. Best of all, it’s free to download and install.</p><p> With LM Studio, you can access <a class="link"   href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-picture-perfect-presentation-software-for-impeccable-photo-framing/" >large language models (LLMs) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>—these are like vast libraries of information that can help you with just about anything, from how to fix a flat tire to writing computer code. And since it operates on your computer, your data stays private and isn’t used for other purposes.</p><p> To get started with a local AI chatbot on Windows, your computer must meet certain specifications. A good graphics card is important; for example, I use an RTX 4060 with 8GB of video memory. You’ll also need at least 8 GB of RAM to run most models, though I recommend 32 GB for the best performance.</p><p> If <a class="link"   href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-activate-and-use-life360-ghost-mode-on-oppo-find-n3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >upgrading your graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is outside your budget, don’t worry—you can also run LM Studio using your computer’s processor (CPU). It won’t be as fast as using a specialized graphics card, but it’s a great alternative.</p><p> Now that you know what LM Studio is and what you need to run it, let’s explore how you can start using it on your Windows PC.</p><h2 id="Quick-Setup-Quick-Start"><a href="#Quick-Setup-Quick-Start" class="headerlink" title="Quick Setup, Quick Start"></a>Quick Setup, Quick Start</h2><p> To use LM Studio on Windows to run different local AI chatbots, you need to download the program. Head over to <a class="link"   href="http://lmstudio.ai/" >LMStudio.ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and select “Download LM Studio for Windows”.</p><p> After you’ve downloaded the LM Studio installer to Windows, launch Explorer, select the “Downloads” folder, and double-click the EXE to launch the installer to set up LM Studio on your computer.</p><p> You’ll then need to go through the installation process on your Windows PC, which shouldn’t take very long. After setting it up, launch LM Studio. Then, with the LM Studio app open, locate the search box at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lm-studio-home.jpg"                      alt="The LM Studio home page."                > </p><p> You can use this search box to browse for various models, like Facebook’s Llama 3, Mistral AI’s model, Google Gemma, Phi 2, and so many more.</p><h2 id="Choose-Your-AI-Model"><a href="#Choose-Your-AI-Model" class="headerlink" title="Choose Your AI Model"></a>Choose Your AI Model</h2><p> LM Studio offers a wide array of AI models for you to explore. To find and download an LLM, enter the name in the search bar at the top, then click the corresponding download button on the right-hand side. Note how many variants are available for Llama 3 alone. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/click-dl.png"                      alt="Searching for llama 3 on LM Studio."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137380/7443" target="_top" id="2137380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137380/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you’re unsure, select the most popular result. LM Studio filters by compatibility, so it should work on your system. For more information, click the “What’s the difference between all these files? Which one should I download?” button. It explains each model and helps you decide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/qwen-ai-model-search-lmstudio.jpg"                      alt="The search results for Qwen"                > </p><p> For example, Llama 3 powers the “Messenger AI” feature on Facebook and matches the intelligence of tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lm-studio-advice.jpg"                      alt="LM Studio giving me advice."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135395/19272" target="_top" id="2135395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135395/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Google Gemma is another excellent choice. This collection of smart models powers Google’s Gemini tool, catering to various needs. CodeGemma can help you write computer code, while RecurrentGemma is a fast, versatile chat model. Just search for “Gemma” on LM Studio and download the one that suits your needs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lm-studio-poem.jpg"                      alt="LM Studio writing a poem."                > </p><p> Also, don’t overlook Mistral. It’s fast, free, and adaptable. Whether you need to process large amounts of text with Mistral 7B or handle more complex tasks with Mistral Large, just search “Mistral” in LM Studio, and you’re set.</p><p> There’s plenty more to discover! Dive into the “Home” section of LM Studio, pick something that catches your eye, and hit “Download.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lm-studio-models.jpg"                      alt="the LM Studio models search page."                > </p><p> Once you’ve selected your model, it’s time to start chatting.

Everything you communicate with your AI chatbot remains securely stored on your local computer—no external access is permitted. Your chat data is never used for training, sold, or exploited in any way.</p><p> Moreover, you have complete control over your data. You can effortlessly export your conversations from LM Studio in various formats such as JSON or as screenshots, ensuring that you manage your data how you see fit.</p><p> If concerns about the privacy implications of technologies like Co-Pilot, ChatGPT, and Gemini weigh on you, LM Studio offers a secure alternative that keeps your interactions private.</p><h2 id="How-I-Use-LM-Studio"><a href="#How-I-Use-LM-Studio" class="headerlink" title="How I Use LM Studio"></a>How I Use LM Studio</h2><p> I use LM Studio for several purposes, and one of the most useful is to automate my daily setup on Windows 11. I’ve developed a PowerShell script with LM Studio that launches my preferred applications—Firefox, Windows Terminal, Ghostwriter (my favorite writing tool), Spotify, and others when I want to get to work. This automation skips the hassle of opening each program individually and helps me jump straight into my tasks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lm-code-instruct.jpg"                      alt="LM Studio writing a script."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100542/7443" target="_top" id="2100542">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100542" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100542/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> In addition to script writing, I’ve found LM Studio particularly helpful in improving my programming skills, which are a work in progress. I primarily use the code-instruct model to enhance my understanding of Go and Python. LM Studio supports a wide range of programming languages, making it an invaluable, free resource for learning and refining coding skills.</p><p> However, the capabilities of LM Studio extend beyond scripting and programming. It’s excellent for addressing complex questions, making it a great tool for thought experiments. I also use it for generating creative solutions and even deciding what to cook for dinner. Whether for streamlining everyday tasks or brainstorming innovative ideas, LM Studio is a versatile tool that maximizes the benefits of local AI technology for anyone looking to enhance their digital experience.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-edge-your-way-to-success-instagrams-finest-border-applications/"><u>[Updated] Edge Your Way to Success Instagram's Finest Border Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-personalize-facebook-page-with-video-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Personalize Facebook Page with Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-creating-professional-looking-videos-with-windows-8-movie-maker/"><u>2024 Approved Creating Professional-Looking Videos with Windows 8 Movie Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/elevating-your-gopro-vlogs-with-professionals-strategies/"><u>Elevating Your Gopro Vlogs with Professionals Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/enhancing-corporate-efficiency-with-abbyys-cognitive-capture-solutions-for-digital-transformation/"><u>Enhancing Corporate Efficiency with ABBYY's Cognitive Capture Solutions for Digital Transformation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/hacks-to-do-pokemon-go-trainer-battles-for-vivo-t2-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Hacks to do pokemon go trainer battles For Vivo T2 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-pin-codepattern-lockpassword-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra PIN Code/Pattern Lock/Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-disabled-iphone-6-plus-without-itunes-in-5-ways-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Your Disabled iPhone 6 Plus Without iTunes in 5 Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-pokemon-evolve-with-a-dawn-stone-for-xiaomi-13-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, What Pokémon Evolve with A Dawn Stone For Xiaomi 13 Ultra? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/unlocking-better-performance-discover-the-7-crucial-windows-configurations-that-must-stay-on-for-optimal-use/"><u>Unlocking Better Performance: Discover the 7 Crucial Windows Configurations That Must Stay On for Optimal Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/unlocking-hidden-gems-the-top-14-facetime-tricks-youre-not-using/"><u>Unlocking Hidden Gems: The Top 14 FaceTime Tricks You're Not Using</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/upgrade-to-a-samsung-galaxy-book-4-unlock-savings-with-trade-in-deals/"><u>Upgrade to a Samsung Galaxy Book 4 - Unlock Savings with Trade-In Deals!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/windows-migrants-beware-7-peculiar-mac-habits-that-will-surprise-you/"><u>Windows Migrants Beware: 7 Peculiar Mac Habits That Will Surprise You</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Beware and stay alert.</li><li>Signs of a voice cloning scam include inconsistencies in vocal cadence, urgency, and unfamiliar phone numbers.</li><li>Protect yourself by creating a safe phrase with loved ones, taking time to think before taking immediate action, and verifying information independently.</li></ul><p> Cloning someone’s voice using AI is now easy enough even scammers can do it. People are already being victimized by this abuse of AI technology, but you don’t have to be the next person to fall for the scam. Here’s how you can beat them before they get you.</p><h2 id="How-Voice-Cloning-Scams-Work"><a href="#How-Voice-Cloning-Scams-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Voice Cloning Scams Work"></a>How Voice Cloning Scams Work</h2><p> Imagine getting a phone call from a family member. It’s 3AM, they’ve been in an accident, they’ve been arrested, they need money to post bail. You get passed to his “lawyer” and are asked to wire money. This is what happened to attorney <a class="link"   href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/ai-phone-scam-voice-call-b2459449.html" >Gary Schildhorn <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. What about getting a call from your daughter, claiming that she’s been kidnapped, but she’s asleep in bed. That happened to <a class="link"   href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scammers-ai-mimic-voices-loved-ones-in-distress/" >Jennifer DeStefano <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and could have ended much worse if the scammers had timed things differently.</p><p> By <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-crafting-visual-wonders-home-made-effects-demystified/" >misusing AI software tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that can create voice profiles from, for example, videos someone might leave on social media, scammers can tap into our emotions to make us behave irrationally. This is already happening and will only increase in sophistication, so there’s no better time to arm yourself with knowledge and strategies to combat this.</p><h2 id="Signs-That-You’re-Being-Scammed"><a href="#Signs-That-You’re-Being-Scammed" class="headerlink" title="Signs That You’re Being Scammed"></a>Signs That You’re Being Scammed</h2><p> While it can be hard to tell the difference between a cloned voice and the real thing, there are a few signs that might tip you off that something isn’t right:</p><ul><li>The vocal cadence, pronunciation, vocabulary, and style aren’t quite right. Sure, people can sound different in an emergency, but try to pay attention to the finer details of their speech, and it might tip you off.</li><li>The scammer will try to spend as little time as possible speaking with you, likely handing you off to a stranger so that you won’t catch on.</li><li>There’s a massive sense of urgency, even when there doesn’t need to be. Scammers aren’t likely to use a true emergency as a pretense, since that doesn’t fit their needs.</li><li>The phone number is unfamiliar, although <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/024-approved-mastering-content-the-key-to-engaging-yt-shorts/" >numbers can be spoofed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of course.</li></ul><p> The most important thing is to be aware that such scams are possible, and to have healthy skepticism when you’re confronted by these types of semi-emergency scenarios.</p><h2 id="Decide-on-a-Safe-Phrase-With-Family-and-Friends"><a href="#Decide-on-a-Safe-Phrase-With-Family-and-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Decide on a Safe Phrase With Family and Friends"></a>Decide on a Safe Phrase With Family and Friends</h2><p> The scammers have done some research on the information that’s publicly available about you and the person they are impersonating. However, if you take the time to come up with a safe word or a phrase that’s only known to you and your loved ones, then you can confirm you’re speaking to the real person. This phrase must never be written down or sent over the internet.</p><p> Then, if you ever receive an emergency call, you can just ask for the safe word and unless the scammer can somehow guess it, you’ll stop the whole scam in its tracks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918719/19272" target="_top" id="1918719">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918719" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918719/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Stop-to-Think"><a href="#Stop-to-Think" class="headerlink" title="Stop to Think"></a>Stop to Think</h2><p> A hallmark of scams, both old and new, is to stop you from having time to think. The less time we have to make decisions, the worse our decisions tend to be. They don’t want you thinking too much or you might notice gaps in the story or realize you’re being asked to do unreasonable or illogical things. So, once you’re off the phone, take five minutes and just think about everything that’s been said. Does it really all make sense?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134489/18498" target="_top" id="2134489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134489/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Get-Third-Party-Information-Verification"><a href="#Get-Third-Party-Information-Verification" class="headerlink" title="Get Third-Party Information Verification"></a>Get Third-Party Information Verification</h2><p> Finally, the easiest way to expose one of these scams is to take control over where your information is coming from. Have you only been speaking to people who have phoned you? Phone the person who supposedly called you. Phone someone close to them. Message them, do anything using a communication channel the scammers have no control over. You can figure out if something has really happened in seconds just by taking a minute to do your own investigations.</p><hr><p> The most powerful weapon against scams like these are the simple knowledge that they exist. After all, if you didn’t know this was possible, how could you defend against it. Now you <em>do</em> know, so there’s no reason to fall for that trick we first saw in the Terminator movies.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-connecting-with-the-world-how-to-use-roku-for-fb-live-for-2024/"><u>[New] Connecting With The World How to Use Roku for FB Live for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-zoom-inout-in-instagram-stories-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Zoom In/Out in Instagram Stories for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-best-fake-gps-location-spoofers-for-honor-x50-gt-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 10 Best Fake GPS Location Spoofers for Honor X50 GT | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-apple-iphone-x-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone X | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-two-ways-to-sync-contacts-from-itel-a70-to-gmail-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, Two Ways to Sync Contacts from Itel A70 to Gmail | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/mastering-game-control-avoiding-interference-from-windows-key-and-accessibility-shortcuts/"><u>Mastering Game Control: Avoiding Interference From Windows Key & Accessibility Shortcuts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/prepare-for-automatic-installation-of-windows-11-version-23h2-on-your-pc/"><u>Prepare for Automatic Installation of Windows 11 Version 23H2 on Your PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/punpixel-patterner/"><u>PunPixel Patterner</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/reviving-objectdock-bringing-mac-like-dock-functionality-to-windows-11/"><u>Reviving ObjectDock: Bringing Mac-Like Dock Functionality to Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/simplifying-your-experience-the-ever-evolving-user-friendliness-of-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/"><u>Simplifying Your Experience: The Ever-Evolving User-Friendliness of the Windows Subsystem for Linux</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/solve-your-wi-fi-woes-a-guide-to-restoring-internet-access-in-windows-11-with-10-effective-tips/"><u>Solve Your Wi-Fi Woes!

This is why you should thoroughly examine the laptop before closing the deal to avoid unpleasant surprises later on. If you doubt the credibility of the seller, here’s how you can test the used laptop.</p><h2 id="Test-the-Keyboard-and-Trackpad"><a href="#Test-the-Keyboard-and-Trackpad" class="headerlink" title="Test the Keyboard and Trackpad"></a>Test the Keyboard and Trackpad</h2><p> Begin the laptop inspection by testing the keyboard and trackpad first. To test the keyboard, go to a keyboard testing website like <a class="link"   href="https://www.keyboardtester.com/tester.html" >Keyboard Tester <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and press each key from the first to the last. If all keys register correctly, the keyboard is likely in good condition. Also, make sure you feel comfortable typing on the keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-keyboard-tester-typing-letters-in-lowercase-with-caps-lock-off.jpg"                      alt="Keyboard tester typing letters in lowercase with Caps Lock off."                > </p><p> To test the trackpad, hover over the screen to gauge its responsiveness. Then, experiment with different trackpad gestures, such as pinch-to-zoom and two-finger scroll, to see which ones are supported. If you have another laptop, you can compare trackpad responsiveness by conducting a touchpad accuracy test on both laptops using the <a class="link"   href="https://no-cursor.com/" >No-Cursor website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> This will help you confirm whether the trackpad on your new laptop is equally or more responsive than the other one.</p><h2 id="Test-the-Speakers-and-Built-In-Microphone"><a href="#Test-the-Speakers-and-Built-In-Microphone" class="headerlink" title="Test the Speakers and Built-In Microphone"></a>Test the Speakers and Built-In Microphone</h2><p> Next, you should test the built-in microphone and speaker. While you can simply play and record something to check if the audio input and output devices are working fine, Windows also offers a way to test them in Settings. On Windows 11, right-click on the Start button and select “Settings.” Then, navigate to System &gt; Sound.</p><p> To test the built-in speakers, click on “Speakers” under Output, which will open the sound settings. Here, click on the “Test” button next to Format. If you hear clear sound coming out of your laptop speaker without distortion or muffling, it’s working properly. If the audio output is unclear, there may be an issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-testing-the-laptop-speaker-in-settings.jpg"                      alt="Testing the laptop speaker in Settings."                > </p><p> To <a class="link"   href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/preparation-to-beat-giovani-in-pokemon-go-for-vivo-y200e-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >test the built-in microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, return to the sound settings, click on “Microphone Array,” and then click on the “Start Test” button next to Test Your Microphone. Speak for a few seconds, then stop the test. If you see a decent volume percentage recorded, the microphone is working as it should.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-testing-the-laptop-microphone-in-settings.jpg"                      alt="Testing the laptop microphone in Settings."                > </p><h2 id="Test-the-Built-In-Camera"><a href="#Test-the-Built-In-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Test the Built-In Camera"></a>Test the Built-In Camera</h2><p> If you intend to use the laptop for video communication, test its built-in camera. To do this, type <strong>Camera</strong> in the Windows Search bar and open the Camera app.</p><p> If the camera app detects the webcam and the visuals are clear and of satisfactory quality, as the seller claimed, then the camera is working correctly.</p><h2 id="Check-the-Health-of-Your-Laptop-Battery"><a href="#Check-the-Health-of-Your-Laptop-Battery" class="headerlink" title="Check the Health of Your Laptop Battery"></a>Check the Health of Your Laptop Battery</h2><p> The more a laptop is used, the more its battery capacity diminishes. When purchasing a new laptop, you should ensure that it’s not heavily worn out. You can check this by generating a battery health report on Windows. <a class="link"   href="https://win11.techidaily.com/a-guide-to-quickly-opens-sticky-notes-in-windows-11/" >Open the Windows PowerShell utility as an administrator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, enter the following command, and press Enter:</p><pre><code>    `Powercfg /batteryreport`</code></pre><p> This command automatically generates the report and saves it at C:\Users[YOUR USERNAME]\battery-report.html.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/br_2-1.png"                      alt="Generating the battery health report from Windows PowerShell."                > </p><p> Navigate to this location and open the battery report. Then, go to the “Installed Batteries” section and compare the “Design Capacity” with the “Full Charge Capacity.” The difference between these values indicates the extent to which the battery’s capacity has diminished due to usage. If the full charge capacity is significantly low, you may have to replace the battery.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/br_5.png"                      alt="Checking the laptop battery report."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137221/26400" target="_top" id="2137221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137221/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Ensure-the-Laptop-Isn’t-Stolen"><a href="#Ensure-the-Laptop-Isn’t-Stolen" class="headerlink" title="Ensure the Laptop Isn’t Stolen"></a>Ensure the Laptop Isn’t Stolen</h2><p> If you’re thinking about buying a used laptop from an unknown seller, make sure that it hasn’t been stolen. One way to check this is to request a purchase receipt from the seller. If they are unable to provide one, this could be a red flag.

To test the RAM, you can use the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool, which detects and displays potential issues with it. To run the test, open Command Prompt as an administrator, type <strong>mdsched.exe</strong>, and press Enter. Then, click “Restart Now and Check for Problems.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/3-running-the-memory-diagnostic-test-from-windows-command-prompt.jpg"                      alt="Running the memory diagnostic test from Windows Command Prompt."                > </p><p> Windows will restart and run the test.

If you don’t see them, you can use the Windows Event Viewer to search for potential issues identified during the test. Open Event Viewer and go to Windows Logs &gt; System. Click “Find,” type <strong>MemoryDiagnostic</strong>, and click “Find Next.”</p><p> Check the laptop’s storage drive to see if it is an SSD rather than an HDD. SSDs are preferable due to their speed and quiet operation. You should treat any laptop with a hard drive somewhat skeptically. Hard drives haven’t been the norm in many years, and finding one indicates that the laptop is likely quite old. Whichever you find, <a class="link"   href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/preserve-the-purity-of-your-productions/" >check the drive’s health <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to ensure it isn’t dying.</p><hr><p> Buying a used laptop is affordable but risky. Following the tips above will help you spot potential issues with the device and minimize the risks of buying a faulty second-hand laptop. If you can only test the laptop after buying online, purchase from platforms like Amazon or BestBuy that offer refunds for faulty or falsely advertised items.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-essential-techniques-for-convenient-iphone-screen-recording/"><u>[New] Essential Techniques for Convenient Iphone Screen Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-bridging-games-and-friends-xbox-live-to-facebook-broadcasting/"><u>2024 Approved Bridging Games and Friends Xbox Live to Facebook Broadcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-shopping-highlights-editing-steps-for-hauls-and-collections/"><u>2024 Approved Shopping Highlights Editing Steps for Hauls & Collections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/easy-recording-tips-for-your-hp-laptops-camera/"><u>Easy Recording Tips for Your HP Laptop's Camera</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/embrace-change-on-the-move-with-flexible-tripod-12/"><u>Embrace Change on the Move with Flexible Tripod 12</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/exploring-the-need-for-enhanced-capabilities-in-modern-smartphones/"><u>Exploring the Need for Enhanced Capabilities in Modern Smartphones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/get-your-personalized-internet-access-with-spacexs-new-portable-starlink-mini-device/"><u>Get Your Personalized Internet Access with SpaceX’s New Portable Starlink Mini Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/how-cozi-became-the-ultimate-tool-for-keeping-my-family-life-in-perfect-harmony/"><u>How Cozi Became the Ultimate Tool for Keeping My Family Life in Perfect Harmony</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/how-factory-restoring-can-potentially-ruin-your-pixel-6/"><u>How Factory Restoring Can Potentially Ruin Your Pixel 6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/how-iphone-loyalists-embrace-apples-strict-guidelines-despite-limitations/"><u>How iPhone Loyalists Embrace Apple's Strict Guidelines Despite Limitations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-leveraging-board-features-for-virtual-collaboration-android-ios-and-windows-guide/"><u>In 2024, Leveraging Board Features for Virtual Collaboration Android, iOS & Windows Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/is-the-fitbit-charge-3-worth-buying-comprehensive-review/"><u>Is the Fitbit Charge 3 Worth Buying – Comprehensive Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/oneplus-tablet-2-unveiled-featuring-superior-3k-display-and-advanced-snapdragon-processor/"><u>OnePlus Tablet 2 Unveiled Featuring Superior 3K Display & Advanced Snapdragon Processor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/um-tools-for-saving-your-live-video-memories-for-2024/"><u>Premium Tools for Saving Your Live Video Memories for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/retrospective-showdown-2023s-android-versus-the-first-lollipop-release-in-2014/"><u>Retrospective Showdown: 2023'S Android Versus the First Lollipop Release in 2014</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/tailoring-thumbnails-on-your-pc-a-guide/"><u>Tailoring Thumbnails on Your PC: A Guide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Here we’ll look at what causes the battery in an EV to degrade, and why.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-heres-what-you-dont-know-about-instagram-story-viewer2/" >How Does an Electric Vehicle Work? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="How-An-EV-Battery-Degrades-Over-Time"><a href="#How-An-EV-Battery-Degrades-Over-Time" class="headerlink" title="How An EV Battery Degrades Over Time"></a>How An EV Battery Degrades Over Time</h2><p> Two main factors will affect the speed at which an EV’s battery degrades: how old the battery is, and your use and environment. The second category includes things like how the electric car is driven, how the battery is charged, how the vehicle is stored, and environmental factors like climate.</p><h3 id="Battery-Age"><a href="#Battery-Age" class="headerlink" title="Battery Age"></a>Battery Age</h3><p> The first category, degradation due to the battery’s age, is inevitable—<a class="link"   href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-ranking-the-ultimate-in-mac-gif-recorders/" >all lithium-ion batteries steadily decline in effectiveness <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with use over time. This is also called calendar aging, and it’s a very gradual process. It also doesn’t happen at the same rate year-over-year.</p><p> According to electric vehicle startup Recurrent, which monitors and provides shoppers with <a class="link"   href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/for-shoppers" >reports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on used electric vehicles, EV batteries see their biggest declines in capacity at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/how-batteries-degrade" >beginning and the end <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of their usable lifespan. There’s usually a quick drop-off at first, which levels out once the battery becomes stabilized, then another drop after a few years. These decreases are usually small, between 5-10% of overall capacity even after thousands of miles.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-ranking-the-ultimate-in-mac-gif-recorders/" >Debunking Battery Life Myths for Mobile Phones, Tablets, and Laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> So why does this degradation happen? Because of the way lithium-ion batteries are built and how they work. Electric car batteries rely on chemical reactions to generate the electrons that power the car’s motor. They generate them by using what’s called an “active material” to spark the reaction. In Li-ion batteries, that material is lithium.</p><p> As the battery is used over and over again, some of that lithium is used up permanently. When that happens for long enough, you see a decrease in the overall charge that the battery can hold because there’s just not enough active material to generate the same amount of energy. This type of degradation is also called capacity fade.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111965/7443" target="_top" id="2111965">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111965" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111965/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Environmental-and-Use-Factors"><a href="#Environmental-and-Use-Factors" class="headerlink" title="Environmental and Use Factors"></a>Environmental and Use Factors</h3><p> Environmental factors, especially temperature, are proven to affect how well an EV’s battery works. <a class="link"   href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-9-mind-blowing-tricks-to-hatch-eggs-in-pokemon-go-without-walking-on-poco-x5-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >In very cold weather <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, for example, the liquid inside an electric car’s battery becomes more viscous, slowing the reactions necessary to generate electricity. That means less electricity is available for the motor to use, so you have less power to accelerate. This is called, unsurprisingly, power fade. EVs are built with temperature regulation systems to help keep this from happening, but in extreme weather, it’ll still be an issue to some degree. Corrosion or buildup inside the battery over time can also result in power fade.</p><p> And it isn’t just cold weather. Heat degrades capacity temporarily and can contribute to accelerated capacity loss overall, but the difference in capacity lost between temperate and hot climates is small for modern EVs. As <a class="link"   href="https://www.cars.com/articles/your-guide-to-ev-batteries-premature-death-range-loss-and-preservation-446126/#range-loss-is-guaranteed-by-age" >Cars.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> puts it:</p><blockquote><p>“According to Geotab data, after four years, an EV in a temperate climate shows less battery degradation than one in a hot climate, but the difference is less than a quarter of a percent…A comparison of one 2015 model EV without active thermal management, the Nissan Leaf, with another 2015 that has it, the Tesla Model S, might be the most useful: Geotab reports the Leaf’s average degeneration rate at 4.2% and the Model S’ at 2.3%.”</p></blockquote><p> Relying heavily on DC fast charging (DCFC) stations will also degrade an EV’s battery life. Automaker Kia <a class="link"   href="https://www.kia.com/dm/discover-kia/ask/how-to-extend-ev-battery-life.html" >attributes 10% <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> capacity loss over a battery’s lifetime to excessive DCFC use. DCFC puts a heavy load on the battery pack in order to funnel all that power in so quickly, the same as constantly <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/enhance-mobile-viewing-fb-videos-on-android/" >using fast charging on your cell phone will shorten its battery life <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. That’s because the more power you put into the battery, the more forcefully electrons and ions get moved around the interior of the battery cells. That can cause micro-damage and extra stress on the battery components, eventually wearing down capacity when done too often.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/unveiling-wintv-magic-compre-written-guide-to-capturing-live-on-windows-pc-for-2024/" >Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3? EV Chargers Explained <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> Most electric car manufacturers agree fast charging should be used “sparingly,” but as of this writing, there’s no set definition of what sparingly means. A good rule to go by is to fast charge as little as possible, when it can’t be avoided or on long trips, and stick to regular <a class="link"   href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/unveiling-wintv-magic-compre-written-guide-to-capturing-live-on-windows-pc-for-2024/" >level 1 or 2 charging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> most of the time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896527/19272" target="_top" id="1896527">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896527" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896527/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-You-Be-Worried-About-Battery-Degradation"><a href="#Should-You-Be-Worried-About-Battery-Degradation" class="headerlink" title="Should You Be Worried About Battery Degradation?"></a>Should You Be Worried About Battery Degradation?</h2><p> As long as you’re aware the battery will decrease in capacity, slowly, over time, you shouldn’t need to worry about degradation much. You will want to plan for that decrease ahead of time, though, and factor it into your calculations of how far you’ll be able to drive the vehicle a few years down the line. As far as complete failure is concerned, total battery failure is very rare and usually covered by the manufacturer’s warranty.</p><p> Some degradation is inevitable, but if you take good care of the battery, chances are it’ll keep most of its range well into the car’s lifespan. Avoid too much DCFC charging. Precondition the battery in extreme heat or cold before charging. Leave the vehicle plugged into a charger when you can to conserve power. Consider the climate where you live and how it could affect the battery before you buy. As technology improves, many of these constraints on EV battery power and life could lessen or disappear entirely. That’s especially good news if you know <a class="link"   href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-retrieve-lost-pictures-from-oppo-reno-11f-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/" >the cost of replacing an EV battery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-retrieve-lost-pictures-from-oppo-reno-11f-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/" >How Much Does an Electric Car Battery Replacement Cost? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-5-simple-ways-to-save-your-youtube-content/"><u>[New] In 2024, 5 Simple Ways to Save Your YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-iphone-tips-achieving-extended-exposure-images-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] IPhone Tips Achieving Extended Exposure Images for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-the-secrets-of-color-balance-in-gopro-videos/"><u>[Updated] Unlock the Secrets of Color Balance in GoPro Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/combating-synthetic-speech-deception-tips-for-safeguarding-personal-data-from-ai-voice-cloning-threats/"><u>Combating Synthetic Speech Deception: Tips for Safeguarding Personal Data From AI Voice Cloning Threats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/creating-music-with-ai-without-spending-a-penny-discover-5-effective-techniques/"><u>Creating Music with AI Without Spending a Penny: Discover 5 Effective Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/decoding-the-purpose-and-functionality-of-crypto-hardware-wallets/"><u>Decoding the Purpose and Functionality of Crypto Hardware Wallets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/demystifying-cryptocurrency-mining-a-comparison-between-proof-of-work-and-proof-of-stake/"><u>Demystifying Cryptocurrency Mining: A Comparison Between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/elevate-your-ai-imagery-discover-the-top-8-midjourney-modifiers-that-enhance-creativity/"><u>Elevate Your AI Imagery: Discover the Top 8 Midjourney Modifiers That Enhance Creativity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/guide-activating-universal-dark-mode-feature-on-any-site-with-google-chrome/"><u>Guide: Activating Universal Dark Mode Feature on Any Site with Google Chrome</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-get-and-use-pokemon-go-promo-codes-on-vivo-s18-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Get and Use Pokemon Go Promo Codes On Vivo S18 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-does-itools-virtual-location-not-work-for-apple-iphone-15-plusipad-solved-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Why Does iTools Virtual Location Not Work For Apple iPhone 15 Plus/iPad?

My favorite place to look when I want to refresh my playlists is Apple Music Radio. I always manage to find new music tailored to what I’m looking for.</p><h2 id="Free-Radio-Stations"><a href="#Free-Radio-Stations" class="headerlink" title="Free Radio Stations"></a>Free Radio Stations</h2><p> Though many of Apple Music Radio’s features require an <a class="link"   href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/most-asked-questions-about-pokemon-go-battle-league-rewards-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/" >Apple Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> subscription, the service still offers some radio stations free of charge. As of writing this article, the hugely popular Apple Music 1 does not require a subscription, as well as Apple Music Hits and Apple Music Country.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot-2024-06-21-at-11-45-20-am.png"                      alt="Apple Music&#39;s free radio stations, including local broadcasts and Music 1."                > </p><p> You are also able to listen to local and international radio stations through iHeartRadio and TuneIn without an Apple Music subscription. FM radio is one of my favorite ways to find new stuff to listen to, and having access to it right from the Apple Music app is perfect.</p><p> To find stations, open Apple Music and hit the “Radio” tab then browse. You can also run a search for a genre, place, or topic. Now look through the search results for the “Radio” section and click “Play” to tune in.</p><h2 id="Hosted-Stations-and-Artist-Interviews"><a href="#Hosted-Stations-and-Artist-Interviews" class="headerlink" title="Hosted Stations and Artist Interviews"></a>Hosted Stations and Artist Interviews</h2><p> For access to Apple Music Radio’s entire catalog of stations and music-related content, you will need to purchase an Apple Music Subscription ($10.99&#x2F;month for an individual subscription). The full library includes tons of content, including huge backlogs of shows from Apple Music’s team of radio hosts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot-2024-06-21-at-11-58-57-am-1.png"                      alt="Selection of hosted and curated radio shows on Apple Music."                > </p><p> There are also plenty of stations hosted by artists, including Elton John, Vince Staples, Dolly Parton, and more. With tons of shows sorted by genre and previous episodes available on demand, Apple Music’s radio shows are a great way to connect with music on a deeper level and find your new favorite songs.</p><h2 id="Playlist-Shows"><a href="#Playlist-Shows" class="headerlink" title="Playlist Shows"></a>Playlist Shows</h2><p> In my opinion, Apple Music’s curated playlists make the subscription to the service worth it. Apple Music Radio takes these playlists to the next level, featuring artist interviews and commentary with each update. Playlist shows are updated weekly, and each new iteration comes with new artist interviews about the chosen songs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot-2024-06-21-at-12-09-44-pm.png"                      alt="Apple Music playlist radio stations."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094480/7443" target="_top" id="2094480">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094480" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094480/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> I always check in with the Rap Life and ALT CTRL playlists whenever I am looking for something new, and the added context and artist interaction adds a layer of depth to the music. You’ll find these on the Apple Music “Radio” tab.</p><h2 id="Genre-and-Catalog-Stations"><a href="#Genre-and-Catalog-Stations" class="headerlink" title="Genre and Catalog Stations"></a>Genre and Catalog Stations</h2><p> Apple Music has a host of available stations based on specific genres and pre-made catalogs for someone looking for more control over what they’re listening to. These stations are not hosted and play music from the title genre or catalog.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot-2024-06-21-at-12-25-36-pm.png"                      alt="Apple Music selection of genre and catalog stations."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006928/19272" target="_top" id="2006928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Unlike the other radio stations, songs played on these stations can be skipped and scrubbed through, meaning you have more control over what you listen to. These stations are great if you are looking for music specific to one genre or from one of Apple Music’s massive catalogs.</p><p> You can browse these under “Stations by Genre” and “Catalog Stations” on the “Radio” tab.</p><h2 id="Custom-Stations"><a href="#Custom-Stations" class="headerlink" title="Custom Stations"></a>Custom Stations</h2><p> One of my <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-instagram-storytelling-with-epic-videos/" >favorite Apple Music features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is Custom Stations. You can create a radio station based on a song, artist, album, or playlist, which will consist of music similar to what you’ve chosen.</p><p> To create a station, click or tap the three dots next to the song, album, or artist you want to use to seed the station, and select “Create Playlist”. This station will not only play music from the same artist or album, but music from similar artists that you might also enjoy. I love this feature when I’m trying to hear more from an artist I like, or songs similar to one I currently have on repeat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot-2024-06-21-at-12-30-22-pm.png"                      alt="Create station button circled next to currently playing song on Apple Music."                > </p><p> There are also a handful of personal stations, including “New Music Mix” and a station named after you, and a personalized station that uses all of your favorite songs on Apple Music. and as well as playing them, plays music similar to what you’ve previously listened to.</p><p> You can find this station under the “Home” tab of Apple Music, labeled with your name. I listen to this station more than any other, as it brings all of my music together and gives me recommendations from all of my favorite genres.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot-2024-06-21-at-12-36-46-pm.png"                      alt="Personal station under &quot;Made for You&quot; tab of Apple Music Radio."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098703/14409" target="_top" id="2098703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098703/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> You can also check out <a class="link"   href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-pokemon-go-no-gps-signal-heres-every-possible-solution-on-htc-u23-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >your Apple Music Replay stations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which are playlists generated based on your most-played songs in a year.</p><hr><p> Apple Music Radio is an often overlooked feature of the Apple Music service, but it has helped me find some of my all-time favorite songs and artists. If you have a subscription and are tired of your current playlist, it is definitely worth checking out.</p><p> Remember that you can <a class="link"   href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-laugh-loom-robotic-deadlines/" >listen to Apple Music on a Windows PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as your Mac, iPhone, iPad, web, and many streaming devices.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-exploring-the-reasons-behind-blue-icons-in-facebooks-chat-communication/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Exploring the Reasons Behind Blue Icons in Facebook’s Chat Communication</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-flawless-online-invitation-crafting-youtube-subscription-buttons/"><u>[Updated] Flawless Online Invitation Crafting YouTube Subscription Buttons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-detecting-block-status-recognizing-on-snapchat-silence/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Detecting Block Status Recognizing On-Snapchat Silence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/2024-approved-analyzing-dji-x4-fpv-helmet-functionality/"><u>2024 Approved Analyzing DJI X4 FPV Helmet Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/7-top-ways-to-resolve-apple-id-not-active-issue-for-iphone-14-by-drfone-ios/"><u>7 Top Ways To Resolve Apple ID Not Active Issue For iPhone 14</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/exploring-the-differences-between-arm-based-windows-11-and-traditional-windows-systems/"><u>Exploring the Differences Between ARM-Based Windows 11 and Traditional Windows Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/fast-and-easy-ways-to-access-your-desktop-in-windows-11/"><u>Fast & Easy Ways to Access Your Desktop in Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/immediate-fixes-for-overcoming-valorants-persistent-graphics-driver-crash-glitch/"><u>Immediate Fixes for Overcoming Valorant's Persistent 'Graphics Driver Crash' Glitch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/introducing-microsofts-latest-innovation-an-ai-enhanced-recall-function-for-personal-computers/"><u>Introducing Microsoft's Latest Innovation: An AI-Enhanced Recall Function for Personal Computers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/two-ways-to-track-my-boyfriends-vivo-y56-5g-without-him-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Two Ways to Track My Boyfriends Vivo Y56 5G without Him Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/king-the-secrets-to-earning-from-viral-snippets/"><u>Unlocking the Secrets to Earning From Viral Snippets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/movaviwebm-to-ogg/"><u>ウィスパーオーディオファイルにリアルタイム変換! - Movaviの無料オンラインWEBM to OGG</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unmatched-User-Experience-The-Ultimate-Blueprint-of-the-Perfect-Timing-App"><a href="#Unmatched-User-Experience-The-Ultimate-Blueprint-of-the-Perfect-Timing-App" class="headerlink" title="Unmatched User Experience: The Ultimate Blueprint of the Perfect Timing App"></a>Unmatched User Experience: The Ultimate Blueprint of the Perfect Timing App</h2><p>It may sound simple, but my favorite app lately has been a timer. Specifically, a timer for steeping tea. You may not drink the multiple cups a day that I do, but I want to talk about what makes it a generally outstanding mobile app.</p><h2 id="Cuppa-Is-a-Niche-But-Model-App"><a href="#Cuppa-Is-a-Niche-But-Model-App" class="headerlink" title="Cuppa Is a Niche But Model App"></a>Cuppa Is a Niche But Model App</h2><p> In my phone, there are two types of apps: ones that are useful and ones I enjoy using. These apps are rarely the same because it seems like every app serving my needs is also designed to do things I don’t want, like hypnotize me with algorithmic entertainment or just sell me laundry detergent.</p><p> Cuppa, though, happens to be an app that both serves my needs and is painless, even enjoyable to use. It’s available for free on Android (at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004180/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nathanatos.Cuppa" >Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or where I get it, on <a class="link"   href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nathanatos.Cuppa/" >F-Droid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) and for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cuppa-tea-timer/id1241458171" >iPhone and iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. There’s also a <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cuppa-tea-timer/id1297865739" >Mac version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Its one job is timing your tea steeping. You don’t need anything to start using it—not even a login. There are no ads and no splash screen showing off some corporate logo, either. You just open the app, and there are your timers for different tea types you simply tap to start.</p><p>Close </p><p> Cuppa is also one of those rare apps that looks humble in presentation but, as you explore it, you discover hidden treats. If you get into the settings, you’ll find a lot of customizability intentionally designed to suit a tea connoisseur. You can add more types and flavors of tea to your timer array, including custom ones, and adjust your preferred steeping times, boiling temperature, and tea-to-water brewing ratio.</p><p> Those options might seem extraneous, but I do have a certain brand of Earl Grey tea I prefer to brew for a shorter amount of time than other brands making the same flavor. That granular customization also makes for better insights if you’ve enabled the timer usage stats. I love that feature because it lets me look back proudly on my brewing habits and, dare I say, complex tea palette. On that note, there’s no network connectivity, either; no one is spying on your tea-brewing habits in Cuppa to sell you more tea.</p><p>Close </p><p> Cuppa is how I wish every app experience was: free of ads, free of corporate tracking, and built to just get out of the way and let you do what you got the app to do. There are robust customization settings enthusiasts like me can tweak, but the defaults will likely serve you well. It feels like a return to form in <a class="link"   href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-ez-grabber-user-manual-in-a-nutshell-for-2024/" >mobile apps’ long history <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="It-Isn’t-Perfect"><a href="#It-Isn’t-Perfect" class="headerlink" title="It Isn’t Perfect"></a>It Isn’t Perfect</h2><p> One drawback is that, because there’s no account registration involved, all of your data is saved to your phone or tablet instead of to a cloud somewhere. That means if you delete the app or change to a different device, you’ll lose your settings and (if enabled) timer usage stats. Fortunately, if you manage to export your data (an option in the settings menu), you can import it into a new instance of the Cuppa app. Just be aware that’s completely up to you; there’s no service that will take care of that for you.</p><p> Beyond that, my only real gripe is about the timer alarm. It’s the sound of a ceramic teacup clattering that, while cute, feels a bit abrasive to me. I wish I could change it to something softer, but at least in the Android app I’ve not been able to find that option.</p><h2 id="More-Apps-Should-Be-Like-This"><a href="#More-Apps-Should-Be-Like-This" class="headerlink" title="More Apps Should Be Like This"></a>More Apps Should Be Like This</h2><p> I like it when an app just lets me do what I got it to do. I’m driven up a wall when I have to watch a splash screen, sign up or log in, look at ads, decline the paid subscription, and so on just to get a simple job done like timing my tea brew.</p><p> Of course, apps don’t come from nowhere. There are software developers who put time and effort into it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Innovative-Move-by-BMW-Integration-Into-Tesla’s-Supercharger-Grid-Enables-Broad-EV-Connectivity-Growth"><a href="#Innovative-Move-by-BMW-Integration-Into-Tesla’s-Supercharger-Grid-Enables-Broad-EV-Connectivity-Growth" class="headerlink" title="Innovative Move by BMW: Integration Into Tesla’s Supercharger Grid Enables Broad EV Connectivity Growth"></a>Innovative Move by BMW: Integration Into Tesla’s Supercharger Grid Enables Broad EV Connectivity Growth</h2><p>Beginning in “early 2025,” new electric vehicles sold by BMW, Rolls-Royce, and MINI will utilize the North American Charging Standard (NACS) in the U.S. and Canada. This will open the door to Tesla’s Supercharger network, as NACS is Tesla’s charging port design. Older BMW Group vehicles that utilize a CCS connector will also gain access to the Supercharger network in 2025, presumably through the use of adapters.</p><p> This news isn’t very surprising. Most automakers plan to adopt NACS in 2025, including Ford, Honda, Rivian, GM, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, and others. Not to mention, BMW Group already committed to help build 30,000 charging stations (NACS and CSS) in <a class="link"   href="http://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0425639EN/seven-automakers-unite-to-create-a-leading-high-powered-charging-network-across-north-america?language=en" >a joint venture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with six other vehicle manufacturers. At the time of writing, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Stellantis are the only major automakers that haven’t announced an NACS transition plan. Stellantis is involved in that joint venture with BMW, though.</p><p> As for <em>why</em> these automakers are transitioning to NACS, Tesla’s connector outnumbers CCS by a wide margin. It’s also smaller and more powerful than CCS, and because it was “<a class="link"   href="http://www.tesla.com/blog/opening-north-american-charging-standard" >open-sourced <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ in 2022, it doesn’t come with any licensing fees. For new customers, the benefits are quite clear. Plus, CCS charging will be offered alongside NACS, so older vehicles won’t be left in the dust.</p><p> Of course, the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is also part of this equation. Bipartisan leadership agreed on a $1.2 trillion package with a heavy focus on electric vehicle infrastructure. By now, automakers know that the lack of charging availability is a huge pain point for customers (and may cause problems as gas vehicles are weaned away), so they’re keen to take advantage of these government subsidies.</p><p> BMW Group currently sells six models of electric vehicle in the United States. All of these vehicles use the CCS connector but will transition to NACS in 2025. Additionally, BMW promises that customers won’t need the Tesla app to pay at Supercharger stations. This information only applies to the United States and Canada. Electric vehicle charging is fairly standardized outside of North America, with Europe tethered to the CCS connector and China sporting its GB&#x2F;T plug.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://www.bmwusanews.com/newsrelease.do?id=4258&mid=" >BMW Group <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-windows-and-mac-recording-tactics-finding-your-perfect-match-freepaid-for-2024/"><u>[New] Windows & Mac Recording Tactics - Finding Your Perfect Match (Free/Paid) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-bytes.techidaily.com/1-effortless-mp3-to-3gp-conversion-get-your-files-online-converted-at-no-cost-with-quickflip/"><u>1.

Gas-fueled cars are among the biggest polluters in our planet, being a significant contributor to CO2 emissions, so moving to electric cars and other forms of transit are important. The United States wants that to happen sooner rather than later, though, and new restrictions on car emissions are being put in place to usher in the EV era more quickly.</p><p> The EPA has implemented stringent new regulations on vehicle emissions after intense lobbying and deliberation. These rules, a core element of the Biden administration’s climate change strategy, are meant to accelerate the transition to <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-charting-2023s-social-trend-peaks-in-graphs/" >electric vehicles (EVs) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the United States. Under these regulations, EVs are projected to constitute up to 56% of new passenger vehicles by 2030-2032, meeting Biden’s ambitious target set in 2021.</p><p> As per these rules, car manufacturers will need to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants starting with model years 2027-2032, so the first cars that will be subject to these regulations will start releasing in 2026. The rules apply to manufacturers’ entire fleets of light-duty and medium-duty vehicles rather than being a hard and fast rule for all vehicles. This means that car manufacturers will still be able to release some cars with higher-emissions as long as it releases other cars that are cleaner. It should also be noted that the regulations do not mandate EVs exclusively, but rather, they set stringent emissions standards for entire vehicle fleets. Car makers don’t <em>have</em> to release EVs, but at some point, they’ll be forced to make some in order to meet these rules.</p><p> Of course, as more and more EVs are sold, the country needs to adapt to them. For example, more charging infrastructure needs to be rolled out so that they eventually become as common of a sight as traditional gas stations. These regulations don’t enter effect immediately, and even when they do, the transition will still be gradual. It will be a few more years before everyone is using an electric vehicle, but we’re slowly getting there.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/20/1239092833/biden-epa-auto-emissions-evs" >NPR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-instagram-adding-borders-to-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Mastering Instagram Adding Borders to Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-playback-paradox-starting-at-the-finish-line-on-youtube/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Playback Paradox Starting at the Finish Line on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-twitter-video-downloader-download-twitter-videos-to-iphone-for-2024/"><u>[New] Twitter Video Downloader Download Twitter Videos to iPhone for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-easy-ios-screen-recording-tips-and-tricks-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Easy iOS Screen Recording Tips & Tricks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-dive-into-digital-clarity-the-guide-for-full-hd-on-tweet/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Dive Into Digital Clarity The Guide for Full HD on Tweet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/how-does-conky-elevate-the-visual-appeal-of-your-linux-workspace/"><u>How Does Conky Elevate the Visual Appeal of Your Linux Workspace?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-from-tecno-spark-20-pro-devices-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass Google FRP Lock from Tecno Spark 20 Pro Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/how-to-set-up-a-personal-streaming-station-with-icecast-on-linux/"><u>How to Set Up a Personal Streaming Station with Icecast on Linux</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location-on-oppo-a79-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location On Oppo A79 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-precision-recording-tips-for-gamers-and-videographers/"><u>In 2024, Precision Recording Tips for Gamers and Videographers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/introducing-windows-11-compatible-logitech-peripherals-enhanced-dynamic-lighting-capability/"><u>Introducing Windows 11 Compatible Logitech Peripherals: Enhanced Dynamic Lighting Capability</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/master-the-art-of-mac-screen-record-via-shortcuts-for-2024/"><u>Master the Art of Mac Screen Record via Shortcuts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/mastering-expression-calculation-a-guide-to-using-expr-on-linux-systems/"><u>Mastering Expression Calculation: A Guide to Using 'Expr' On Linux Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/maximize-your-icloud-capacity-effective-methods-to-clear-and-reclaim-storage/"><u>Maximize Your iCloud Capacity: Effective Methods to Clear and Reclaim Storage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/microsoft-trials-innovative-start-menu-and-promotional-content-integration-in-windows-11-preview/"><u>Microsoft Trials Innovative Start Menu and Promotional Content Integration in Windows 11 Preview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/my-experience-with-a-windows-replica-for-everyday-use-a-comprehensive-review/"><u>My Experience with a Windows Replica for Everyday Use: A Comprehensive Review</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137215/26400" target="_top" id="2137215">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137215" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137215/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

The Windows 11 KB5040442 cumulative update is currently rolling out to 23H2 and 22H2 installations with new Start menu functionality, expanded file archive options, a revived “show desktop” button, and an obligatory advertisement for Game Pass.</p><p> The most notable changes in Windows 11 KB5040442 are tucked within the Start menu and taskbar. A new <a class="link"   href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/bridging-the-gap-between-simple-to-high-tech-hdr-techniques-for-2024/" >account management submenu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which contains security recommendations, active Microsoft subscriptions, and account settings shortcuts, now appears when you click your profile photo in the Start menu.</p><p> You’ll also find that the “show desktop” button, which was previously replaced by a Copilot shortcut, has <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-instagram-soundtracks-law-and-ethics-for-2024/" >returned to its home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the right-hand side of the taskbar. However, you may need to manually re-enable this feature by right-clicking the taskbar, entering “Taskbar settings” and navigating to “Taskbar behaviors.”</p><p>Close </p><p> File management is another major focus of this release. You can now create <a class="link"   href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/idt-software-update-solving-unrecognized-device-issues-effectively/" >7-Zip and TAR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> archives from the File Explorer, and there’s a new compression wizard hidden in the “Additional options” right-click submenu. Files can now be copied to the clipboard from Windows Share menu, and a thin black border now highlights any items you’ve selected in File Explorer.</p><p> Interestingly, Microsoft isn’t going overboard with AI in Windows 11 KB5040442. Copilot has been pinned to the <a class="link"   href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/catchemall-celebrate-national-pokemon-day-with-virtual-location-on-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >center of the taskbar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and now behaves like a proper app instead of an awkward popup menu, but that’s the extent of new AI functionality. And, notably, the updated Copilot behavior is currently limited to <em>new</em> Windows 11 and Copilot+ PCs.</p><p> Other small changes include a new <a class="link"   href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/bridging-the-gap-between-simple-to-high-tech-hdr-techniques-for-2024/" >Game Pass advertisement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the Settings home page, <a class="link"   href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-social-network-videos-downloaded-for-audio-conversion/" >spellcheck in Notepad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and Emoji 15.1 implementation across the Windows 11 operating system (with a unique option that lets you flip some emojis from left to right). Developers also gain an improved VFP for troubleshooting Windows nodes and OneDrive RemoteApp access in Azure Virtual Desktop.</p><p> As for bugfixes, Microsoft addressed a GPU idling bug and an audio quality issue in the Snipping Tool. The taskbar bug that affected Windows N edition users after the previous KB5039302 release has been fixed too.</p><p> Windows 11 KB5040442 is now rolling out to all compatible PCs.

Android’s vendor-neutral default apps have since been replaced by Google apps, and the tech giant has used its dominance to fill our Android devices with far more pre-installed software than any other company.</p><h2 id="Google-and-Android-Are-Not-One-and-the-Same"><a href="#Google-and-Android-Are-Not-One-and-the-Same" class="headerlink" title="Google and Android Are Not One and the Same"></a>Google and Android Are Not One and the Same</h2><p> Google is Android’s primary developer, but the operating system is open source. Countless other companies are invested in the platform.</p><p> There are big-name smartphone makers like Samsung, Motorola, and OnePlus. Tablets and eReaders from Amazon and <a class="link"   href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/prank-your-friends-easy-ways-to-fake-and-share-google-maps-location-on-lava-storm-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >BOOX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Niche products that you may not realize run Android, like <a class="link"   href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-advanced-techniques-capturing-teams-screen-content/" >the minimalist Light Phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the Rabbit R1. There are self-checkout machines in big box stores that are merely Android tablets anchored in place. You may sign in at your dentist’s office with an Android device without being aware of it. They’re everywhere.</p><p> The promise of Android is that it’s a mobile-first operating system that anyone can use to create great things without starting from scratch. This is how Android got buy-in from businesses and volunteers from all over the world. You can use and develop Android without being entirely beholden to the whims of another corporation.</p><h2 id="After-Android-Became-Popular-Google-Wanted-More-Control"><a href="#After-Android-Became-Popular-Google-Wanted-More-Control" class="headerlink" title="After Android Became Popular, Google Wanted More Control"></a>After Android Became Popular, Google Wanted More Control</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/02/the-app-drawer-of-the-oneplus12rjpg_53485300814_o.jpg"                      alt="The app drawer of the OnePlus12R"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144275/7443" target="_top" id="2144275">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144275" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144275/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Jerome Thomas &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> While Android is free, Google has control over the primary way developers distribute their apps to Android users. In order for a company to ship the Play Store on their device, they must agree to include a bundle of Google apps and background services. The company has also been willing to pay big bucks to limit the creation of alternative Android app stores. In 2023, Google lost a case against Epic for monopolistic practices centered around the Play Store, as reported by the <a class="link"   href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67688720" >BBC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Google’s apps are not neutral pieces of software providing needed functionality. They’re Google services like Google Search, Chrome, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Home, Google Docs, and YouTube. Are these programs that many (if not most) Android users would go out of their way to install? Sure, absolutely. But most of them are not essential parts of a phone or tablet. They’re efforts to draw you into the Google ecosystem.</p><p> Google’s insistence on making Android phone makers ship their apps is why a company like Samsung ships duplicate programs on their phones. They either give Google full control over the software experience, or they settle for confusing duplication. Samsung at least tries to clean up the clutter a bit by dumping most of the search giants’ apps into a folder labeled “Google” on the home screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/flip-6-next-to-fold-6-1.jpg"                      alt="Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Fold 6 on a table."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880944/19272" target="_top" id="1880944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880944/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Justin Duino &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Many other companies have stopped making their own software and decided to stick to Google’s defaults instead. There are plenty of users and product reviewers calling for just that. They’re already deep in the Google ecosystem and just want the most optimized experience. Yet this stance ultimately limits the amount of choice available in the market. What’s left for those of us who like Android phones but, after seeing all the shenanigans Google has gotten up to, want to opt out of doing business with them?</p><h2 id="I-Don’t-Want-to-Give-All-of-My-Data-to-Google"><a href="#I-Don’t-Want-to-Give-All-of-My-Data-to-Google" class="headerlink" title="I Don’t Want to Give All of My Data to Google"></a>I Don’t Want to Give All of My Data to Google</h2><p> I made efforts to de-Google my life years ago, deleting my Google account entirely. I re-created one years later when an organization I’m involved with wanted to use Google Calendar to manage our schedule. I started to use this same account to log into Google Play for apps, but that’s about it.</p><p> That means whenever I activate a new Android device, I go through the onboarding process and un-check as many boxes as I can. Then, I spend time uninstalling all the apps I don’t want. Whether I’m setting up a Pixel or a Galaxy Z Fold, the bulk of the apps I’m removing come from Google. I don’t want YouTube Music preinstalled any more than I want to see Facebook or TikTok. I don’t use Chrome as my browser on any device, nor do I use Google Search.</p><p> It’s not that I don’t use any Google apps. I find Google Maps useful, especially due to how much information it provides about local businesses. I watch YouTube, since it is the primary way major and independent publishers alike distribute video. But these apps don’t provide essential phone functionality in the way that a gallery app and a local video player do. They’re the kind of programs many people would immediately seek out on their own in the Play Store. Still, they’re preinstalled to drive more people toward Google services and provide the company with more marketable data.</p><p> People are quick to call out budget Motorola phones for installing unwanted shopping apps and random games, but Google’s software collects far more data and is much more intrusive. We’re just conditioned to expect them, even if we have never once clicked on Google Home.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137207/26400" target="_top" id="2137207">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137207" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137207/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Some-Preinstalled-Apps-Are-Better-Than-Google’s"><a href="#Some-Preinstalled-Apps-Are-Better-Than-Google’s" class="headerlink" title="Some Preinstalled Apps Are Better Than Google’s"></a>Some Preinstalled Apps Are Better Than Google’s</h2><p> Even if I liked the Google ecosystem and actively took part in it, I would still be sad to see Android phone makers give up on making their own software. Some companies <a class="link"   href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-an-examination-of-photoshops-anti-shake-capabilities/" >do a better job at creating certain apps than Google does <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-streamline-your-screen-captures-with-4-methods/" >Samsung Internet is an excellent browser <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s fully capable of replacing a desktop browser, and it has features that Google won’t include because it competes with the company’s business model, such as privacy features that block trackers. Samsung Gallery is one of the best apps for managing photos saved on your device. Samsung Notes is a far more comprehensive note-taking app than Google Keep. Samsung My Files feels more like a desktop file manager than Files By Google.</p><p>Close </p><p> Phone makers don’t have to sacrifice the beauty of stock Android to give us custom software. The few apps Motorola does still provide integrate perfectly with Android’s look and feel. The company includes software for customizing your phone more extensively, adds more gestures, and provides support for connecting your phone to a monitor or a TV (<a class="link"   href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-apple-id-and-apple-password-from-apple-iphone-15-plus-by-drfone-ios/" >or a lapdock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>), using it as either a PC, video game console, or set-top box.</p><p>Close </p><p> Nothing (the company) shows <a class="link"   href="https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/toms-tech-insights-exploring-the-latest-in-hardware-innovation/" >how much style a phone maker can give their phones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> without making their devices as garish and inconsistent as the Android skins of years past. Android would be far less interesting without their innovations and experimentation.</p><h2 id="Google-Apps-Make-Android-Phones-All-Feel-the-Same"><a href="#Google-Apps-Make-Android-Phones-All-Feel-the-Same" class="headerlink" title="Google Apps Make Android Phones All Feel the Same"></a>Google Apps Make Android Phones All Feel the Same</h2><p> As Google’s control over software has grown, there is increasingly less difference between one Android device and the next. You walk through similar set-up screens, are presented with the same data collection options, and see your app drawer pre-populated with largely the same software.</p><p> The diversity of options is a big part of what draws many of us toward Android phones over the iPhone. Yet physical differences now come down to the style of camera bump and branding. Some people used to buy LG phones because they loved the company’s software. That company no longer makes phones. <a class="link"   href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/solving-invalid-drivers-installation-issues-on-your-pc/" >HTC Sense <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was a vibe. The company is still technically around, but its presence and its software are a shadow of its former self. Google software has filled the void.</p><p> Phones aren’t the only devices that suffer from this. Consider the <a class="link"   href="https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-beam-pro" >XREAL Beam Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an Android-based (and far more affordable) alternative to Apple’s Vision Pro. It’s a tempting addition to <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/approved-expert-insights-where-to-invest-in-youtube-creator-revenue/" >the AR glasses I replaced my computer monitor with <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When you launch the device for the first time, you’re presented with a large array of Google apps that you probably didn’t buy AR glasses to use. They continue to clutter up the launcher unless you dive into settings and disable them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/xreal_shot_1723131795364.png"                      alt="Apps in the launcher on an XREAL Beam Pro."                > </p><p> XREAL isn’t a Google company, but since access to the Play Store is a big part of the device’s appeal, they’re required to shill Google services, at a detriment to the user experience.</p><hr><p> I love Android and appreciate the work that (primarily) Google developers put into it. The platform as a whole is far more polished, attractive, and feature-complete than it was back in the day of more diverse Android phones.

    <title>New Feature Alert: Save Location Data Directly on Your Device with Google Maps</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="New-Feature-Alert-Save-Location-Data-Directly-on-Your-Device-with-Google-Maps"><a href="#New-Feature-Alert-Save-Location-Data-Directly-on-Your-Device-with-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="New Feature Alert: Save Location Data Directly on Your Device with Google Maps"></a>New Feature Alert: Save Location Data Directly on Your Device with Google Maps</h2><p>It can be easy to forget sometimes, but Google keeps track of all places you’ve been through the Timeline feature and uploads them to the cloud so you can look at it from any device. It’s meant to be a “convenient” feature, but it can get problematic, especially if other eyes that are not yours get access to that data. That’s why Google is moving it away from the cloud and for your device’s eyes only.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-maximizing-traffic-with-effective-youtube-titles/" >Google Maps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is overhauling its location data storage practices, shifting from cloud-based backups to local storage on users’ devices. The change, part of what might be an increased focus on privacy by, means you will no longer be able to access your Timeline history via the web after December 1st. It’s a big tradeoff to take into account if you happen to be a frequent user of that feature, especially from the browser—I know I’ve checked info about past trips a few times from my browser. At the same time, the prospect of someone being able to access your Google account and see all the places you’ve been, including the roads you took, in pretty deep detail is probably pretty scary.</p><p> If you’re not familiar with the feature, Timeline tracks users’ routes and trips based on their phone’s location data. Instead of linking this information to Google accounts, the data will now be tied to individual devices. So you <em>will</em> still be able to access the data, just not from your computer or from any device that you didn’t take with you to your travels.</p><p> You have until December 1st to save your travel history to your mobile device. After that date, Google will attempt to transfer the most recent 90 days of data to the first device a user signs into Google on, deleting any older data. To continue using Timeline, users must adjust settings in the Google Maps app on their mobile devices. They can choose to retain location data indefinitely until manual deletion or opt for automatic deletion after three, 18, or 36 months. This is not the only move Google has taken to protect users and their privacy, as the company has taken measures such as removing sensitive locations from history and limiting authorities’ access to location data, but this is certainly the most drastic.</p><p> You still have a few months to manually backup your location info if it’s something you care about, but the clock is ticking.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/5/24172204/google-maps-delete-location-history-timeline" >The Verge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-list-for-first-time-film-makers-35mm-to-pands/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Ultimate List for First-Time Film Makers (35Mm to P&S)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-edge-of-innovation-secure-these-7-must-have-devices/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Edge of Innovation Secure These 7 Must-Have Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/12-quick-methods-to-access-windows-10-file-explorer/"><u>12 Quick Methods to Access Windows 10 File Explorer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/access-a-multitude-of-ai-powered-conversational-agents-directly-from-your-personal-computer-using-our-innovative-application/"><u>Access a Multitude of AI-Powered Conversational Agents Directly From Your Personal Computer Using Our Innovative Application</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/ai-conversations-demystified-exploring-the-8-problematic-areas-of-gpt/"><u>AI Conversations Demystified: Exploring the 8 Problematic Areas of GPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/boost-productivity-fast-efficiently-start-programs-via-keyboard-triggers-on-windows-11/"><u>Boost Productivity Fast: Efficiently Start Programs via Keyboard Triggers on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/boost-your-gameplay-the-best-3-software-solutions-for-real-time-pc-gaming-stats-analysis/"><u>Boost Your Gameplay: The Best 3 Software Solutions for Real-Time PC Gaming Stats Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/boosting-focus-using-windows-grokas-pomodoro-timer-in-windows-11-a-pros-and-cons-review/"><u>Boosting Focus Using Windows Grokas Pomodoro Timer in Windows 11 – A Pros and Cons Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/bridging-operating-systems-a-comprehensive-guide-to-using-ubuntu-software-on-your-windows-11-machine/"><u>Bridging Operating Systems: A Comprehensive Guide to Using Ubuntu Software on Your Windows 11 Machine</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/how-to-eliminate-game-crashing-in-doom-eternal-for-a-smooth-experience/"><u>How to Eliminate Game Crashing in DOOM Eternal for a Smooth Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-universal-unlock-pattern-for-vivo-t2-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Universal Unlock Pattern for Vivo T2 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/movavis-no-cost-online-service-change-your-audio-tracks-from-mp3-to-video-on-demand-vob/"><u>Movavi's No-Cost Online Service: Change Your Audio Tracks From MP3 to Video on Demand (VOB)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/supers-clash-rtx-4070-super-versus-titan-and-4080-super-edition/"><u>Supers Clash: RTX 4070 Super Versus Titan and 4080 Super Edition</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123508/26400" target="_top" id="2123508">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123508" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123508/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

As EVs become more affordable and popular, many drivers are buying one of Tesla’s <a class="link"   href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/still-using-pattern-locks-with-infinix-smart-7-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/" >Wall Connector home charging stations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. First-time buyers or retail building owners likely have a lot of questions, including whether you can install a Tesla charger outside.</p><p> While several brands make excellent at-home electric car chargers, Tesla’s are among the most popular. And just like drive-up chargers located throughout the United States, most of which are outdoors, your home wall connector charger is perfectly safe to install and use outdoors. Here’s what new EV owners need to know.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Install-Tesla’s-Wall-Connector-Charger"><a href="#Where-to-Install-Tesla’s-Wall-Connector-Charger" class="headerlink" title="Where to Install Tesla’s Wall Connector Charger?"></a>Where to Install Tesla’s Wall Connector Charger?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tesla-vw-ev-driveway-charging.jpg"                      alt="Two different EVs using Tesla&#39;s new universal home charger."                > </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/universal-wall-connector" >Tesla <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Tesla’s Wall Connector Chargers, or the <a class="link"   href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/still-using-pattern-locks-with-infinix-smart-7-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/" >newest Universal Charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, are all designed for a quick and easy installation. Each unit has integrated terminals, long charging cables, and Wi-Fi for ease of use. Keep in mind that <a class="link"   href="https://www.tesla.com/support/charging/wall-connector/installing" >Tesla recommends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> all chargers be installed at your home or commercial business by a certified professional. Tesla even has a <a class="link"   href="https://www.tesla.com/support/certified-installers?productType=homecharging" >tool to help owners find a certified installer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their area.</p><p> Electric car charging stations are high-voltage electrical systems that require professional installation. Plus, a certified installer will ensure voltage and panel compatibility and help find an ideal location for the charging station.</p><p> Where you install a Tesla Wall Connector depends on your specific situation. Not every home has the same driveway, garage, or ideal placement. Furthermore, some homeowners may have a detached garage that’s not easily accessible or used for parking vehicles, let alone a garage at all. And while Tesla does recommend installing the charger indoors, not to mention it’s best to charge an EV indoors and away from elements and <a class="link"   href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-how-to-use-luts-in-premiere-pro/" >temperature shifts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that doesn’t mean it’s your only option.</p><h2 id="Can-a-Tesla-Charger-Be-Installed-Outside"><a href="#Can-a-Tesla-Charger-Be-Installed-Outside" class="headerlink" title="Can a Tesla Charger Be Installed Outside?"></a>Can a Tesla Charger Be Installed Outside?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tesla-outdoors-charger.jpg"                      alt="Tesla&#39;s Universal Wall Connector installed outdoors."                > </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/universal-wall-connector" >Tesla <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Considering you’re plugging huge wires full of electricity into a massive battery pack, it’s fair to wonder whether home chargers can be installed outdoors. Even though almost every public charger is outdoors and all of Tesla’s website images show its Wall Connectors outside, it’s still a common question. And yes, you can install Tesla’s home chargers (and most other brand options) outdoors without worry.</p><p> Tesla’s Wall Connector home EV chargers are fully weatherproof, have sealed designs, hide any installation wires inside the wall, and even come with long 12, 18, or even 24-foot cables. As a result, installation on the outside of a garage or the front of a home near the driveway is perfectly acceptable.</p><p> Additionally, some owners with a garage but don’t use it for parking still install EV chargers inside, especially if the cable is long enough to reach a vehicle. That way, it’s inside and away from the elements, but the 18-ft cable can still reach a vehicle for charging through the garage door or custom-designed holes in the wall for cable routing. This gives you more flexibility for charger placement and parking.</p><p> As long as you follow the proper protocol for outdoor electrical installations (or hire a professional certified installer), you can absolutely install a Tesla charger outdoors. Furthermore, speeds will not be affected by choosing an outdoor install, yet you’ll have it conveniently located for your situation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137227/26400" target="_top" id="2137227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137227/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Get-Tesla’s-Latest-Universal-Home-Wall-Connector"><a href="#Get-Tesla’s-Latest-Universal-Home-Wall-Connector" class="headerlink" title="Get Tesla’s Latest Universal Home Wall Connector"></a>Get Tesla’s Latest Universal Home Wall Connector</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tesla-home-charger.jpg"                      alt="A home with Tesla&#39;s universal charger installed outside."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770544">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770544">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770544%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770544/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/universal-wall-connector" >Tesla <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> While Tesla already offers a selection of home and business EV chargers, the latest model is a <a class="link"   href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/still-using-pattern-locks-with-infinix-smart-7-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/" >Universal Wall Connector that works with any EV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

And it’s a big deal for all sorts of wide-ranging futuristic reasons to do with the Gemini AI being at your fingertips, satellite messaging letting you text from the boondocks – and a back gesture that, finally, shows you where the swipey thing’s gonna take you back to.  </p><p> But 2024 is also the tenth anniversary of another highly consequential Android release. 2014 saw the release of Android 5 Lollipop – back when times were precedented, Gs were maxed out at four, and updates – whether to new software or a whole new smartphone – were the kind of thing you could really get excited about.  </p><p> Android Lollipop also ushered in the modern age of Android, with the debut of Material Design, 64-bit support, the ART runtime, Project Volta and a TON of other things we take for granted today. So as the Android 15 and Pixel 9 launch begins, it’s time to take a look back at the new Android hotness of a decade ago – and see how it compares to the latest version Google’s preparing for 2025 and beyond.</p><p>more</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-top-vlogging-techniques-for-stellar-gopro-content/"><u>[Updated] Top Vlogging Techniques for Stellar GoPro Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/fire-stick-and-projector-setup-made-easy-expert-connectivity-advice/"><u>Fire Stick & Projector Setup Made Easy: Expert Connectivity Advice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/how-factory-restoring-can-potentially-ruin-your-pixel-6/"><u>How Factory Restoring Can Potentially Ruin Your Pixel 6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-i-transferred-messages-from-infinix-hot-40i-to-iphone-12xs-max-in-seconds-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How I Transferred Messages from Infinix Hot 40i to iPhone 12/XS (Max) in Seconds | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/how-iphone-loyalists-embrace-apples-strict-guidelines-despite-limitations/"><u>How iPhone Loyalists Embrace Apple's Strict Guidelines Despite Limitations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-dose-life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-my-location-on-vivo-y200-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Dose Life360 Notify Me When Someone Checks My Location On Vivo Y200? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/oneplus-tablet-2-unveiled-featuring-superior-3k-display-and-advanced-snapdragon-processor/"><u>OnePlus Tablet 2 Unveiled Featuring Superior 3K Display & Advanced Snapdragon Processor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/premier-tactics-capturing-high-quality-sporting-live-events-for-2024/"><u>Premier Tactics Capturing High-Quality Sporting Live Events for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/revolutionary-voice-capabilities-how-your-iphone-mirrors-the-classic-macintosh/"><u>Revolutionary Voice Capabilities: How Your iPhone Mirrors the Classic Macintosh</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087390/7443" target="_top" id="2087390">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087390" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087390/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

If you haven’t yet tried ChatGPT for custom Excel formulas, you’re missing out on a serious game changer.</p><p> The tips provided in this article aren’t limited to Excel; they’re also applicable to other spreadsheet tools, such as Google Sheets and Apple Numbers. Additionally, this guide focuses on the free version of ChatGPT based on the GPT 3.5 model. If you have access to GPT 4, you can use the Advanced Data Analysis tool to take screenshots and upload Excel files directly to GPT 4 for a more seamless experience.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-a-Quick-Excel-Formula-From-ChatGPT"><a href="#How-to-Get-a-Quick-Excel-Formula-From-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="How to Get a Quick Excel Formula From ChatGPT"></a>How to Get a Quick Excel Formula From ChatGPT</h2><p> If you dread the mere thought of opening Excel, let alone creating formulas, you’ve come to the right place. ChatGPT offers you an easy way to create Excel formulas with zero practical experience required.</p><p> All you have to do is give ChatGPT an explanation of what you want to do, and it’ll give you a formula, along with detailed instructions on how to implement it. Just make sure to mention the range (columns and rows) that you want to apply the formula to, and it’ll do the rest for you. In this example, I have an assortment of orders for various items with varying prices and profit margins.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/test-2.png"                      alt="A list of orders for mugs, spoons, teapots, and kettles in Excel."                > </p><p> My goal is to calculate the revenue and profit for each order. While the formula required to do this isn’t complex, let’s just assume that I knew nothing about Excel, and it was my first day on the job. I’d turn to ChatGPT and ask it for a formula:</p><p>Close </p><p> After pasting the formula into the rows, dragging it down to <a class="link"   href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-5-best-hdmi-21-gaming-monitors-ps5-compatible/" >automatically fill the data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-rapid-reel-sound-mixed-screenshotting/" >changing the format to USD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, I was left with exactly what I was looking for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/asd-1.png"                      alt="A list of articles about ceramic and glass coffee mugs in Excel."                > </p><p> This is just a basic example to show you how ChatGPT can determine what formulas you need based on what you’d like to do. Let’s do something slightly more complicated by asking it to help us <a class="link"   href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/fixing-overwatch-startup-issues-how-to-get-rid-of-the-persistent-black-screen/" >calculate the average <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> profit margin and most profitable item.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/most-profitable.png"                      alt="ChatGPT giving formulas to calculate the average profit margin and most profitable item in Excel."                > </p><p> After implementing the formula, I was once again left with exactly what I was looking for. I double-checked the numbers by calculating everything manually to confirm the formulas worked correctly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/asd.png"                      alt="A list of articles about ceramic and glass coffee mugs in Excel."                > </p><p> If you’re already an Excel aficionado and prefer making formulas yourself, you can ask ChatGPT to suggest the best function for your unique scenario. Let’s say I wanted to import information about the revenue and profits from my orders sheet to a tax sheet. ChatGPT gave me four viable formulas that I could use, along with a brief explanation of how they work.</p><p>Close </p><p> These are just a few basic examples demonstrating what you can do with ChatGPT and Excel. You can use your AI buddy to build upon formulas and organize your data in any way you can imagine. There’s even a new <a class="link"   href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/getting-acquainted-with-quantum-hdr-techniques-for-2024/" >experimental function for custom GPT prompts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The point is that you never have to think about which formula to use or even know how it works. Still, it helps to know a thing or two about Excel to get the most out of it.

This integration allows Copilot to analyze your data and suggest relevant formulas in addition to providing direct access to GPT.</p><h3 id="You-Can-Create-Formatting-Rules-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#You-Can-Create-Formatting-Rules-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="You Can Create Formatting Rules With ChatGPT"></a>You Can Create Formatting Rules With ChatGPT</h3><p> Excel has a complex interface that makes it hard to navigate, especially for novices, and conditional formatting rules require you to poke around to figure them out. In the following example, I have a list of articles with columns that track whether they have been written and have photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new.png"                      alt="A list of articles about ceramic and glass coffee mugs in Excel."                > </p><p> I gave ChatGPT detailed instructions to help me color-code the table so that I could keep track of what articles were still in progress. Here’s my prompt, followed by ChatGPT’s response:</p><p>Close </p><p> I went through the steps exactly how ChatGPT laid them out, and the results are perfect. Even if I had no prior knowledge of using Excel, I would be able to create the formatting rule to keep the project organized.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/newnew.png"                      alt="A list of articles about ceramic and glass coffee mugs in Excel, organized by color."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043618/7443" target="_top" id="2043618">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043618" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043618/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-Can-Troubleshoot-and-Tweak-Your-Formulas"><a href="#ChatGPT-Can-Troubleshoot-and-Tweak-Your-Formulas" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Can Troubleshoot and Tweak Your Formulas"></a>ChatGPT Can Troubleshoot and Tweak Your Formulas</h2><p> Don’t worry if one of the formulas ChatGPT gave you isn’t working as intended—it happens to me all the time. The fix can range from telling ChatGPT, “Hey, this doesn’t work.” to explaining the problem in detail until ChatGPT figures out the issue.</p><p> In the following example, I wanted to calculate the return on investment for my articles, but the first formula that ChatGPT gave me didn’t take into account whether the article had been written yet, making the formula show that I lost $100 for the last two articles. I informed ChatGPT about the discrepancy, and it gave me a new and improved formula.</p><p>Close </p><p> You can also use ChatGPT to identify what’s causing an error. Let’s say an event organizer was trying to calculate the total number of passengers from each city using a simple addition formula and encountered the #VALUE! error because they mixed text and numbers. After explaining the issue to ChatGPT, it immediately recognized the error and gave a fix accompanied by a simple explanation.</p><p>Close </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/1062447/7443" target="_top" id="1062447">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-1062447" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/1062447/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-Still-Need-to-Check-the-Formulas-Manually"><a href="#You-Still-Need-to-Check-the-Formulas-Manually" class="headerlink" title="You Still Need to Check the Formulas Manually"></a>You Still Need to Check the Formulas Manually</h2><p> While ChatGPT is undoubtedly one of the “smartest” tools humans have ever created, it’s not perfect. It might create a formula that doesn’t work correctly, which isn’t a problem when Excel spits out an error. However, in instances where a formula seemingly functions correctly but has omitted an important parameter, it can create a false sense of security.</p><p> This behavior can mislead you into thinking that the data shown is correct when it’s actually being miscalculated. This is why you have to double- and triple-check that your formulas are correct by calculating a few random entries manually. Also, if you gave ChatGPT specific cell ranges and then made changes after inserting the formula, you must ensure that your changes didn’t affect the formula.</p><hr><p> ChatGPT is a real Excel pro, with the caveat that it can’t actually see or understand your sheets, so you have to make sure the formulas work correctly. All you need is a basic understanding of how Excel works, and ChatGPT can create advanced formulas tailored to your unique scenario.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-preserving-sound-integrity-with-ffmpeg-extract/"><u>[New] Preserving Sound Integrity with FFmpeg Extract</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-stream-your-webcam-in-real-time-using-vlc-software/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Stream Your Webcam in Real Time Using VLC Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-airdrop-issues-quick-solutions-for-iphoneipadmac-users/"><u>2024 Approved Mastering AirDrop Issues Quick Solutions for iPhone/iPad/Mac Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-forum.techidaily.com/1726226731192-mp3-mp4-movavi/"><u>立即開始 MP3 和 MP4 格式轉換 - 無限制的 Movavi 免費服務</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/affordable-remobell-security-camera-features-and-performance-under-100/"><u>Affordable RemoBell Security Camera: Features and Performance Under $100</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/apples-services-interrupted-iphone-applications-failing-due-to-system-outages/"><u>Apple's Services Interrupted: IPhone Applications Failing Due to System Outages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/are-folding-phone-innovations-just-for-show-or-here-to-stay-in-the-tech-world/"><u>Are Folding Phone Innovations Just for Show, or Here to Stay in the Tech World?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/best-manycam-alternatives-top-live-streaming-apps-and-fake-camera-solutions/"><u>Best ManyCam Alternatives: Top Live Streaming Apps and Fake Camera Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/celebrate-the-4th-of-july-with-a-spectacular-offer-from-urban-armor-gear-enjoy-20-savings-across-our-entire-collection/"><u>Celebrate the 4Th of July with a Spectacular Offer From Urban Armor Gear - Enjoy 20% Savings Across Our Entire Collection!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/comparing-pixel-pro-8-and-oneplus-12-which-smartphone-takes-the-crown/"><u>Comparing Pixel Pro 8 & OnePlus 12 – Which Smartphone Takes the Crown?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-elevate-your-presentations-with-professional-screencasts/"><u>In 2024, Elevate Your Presentations with Professional Screencasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-superior-lineup-elite-webcam-mounts/"><u>In 2024, Superior Lineup Elite Webcam Mounts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/minute-movie-narrative-blueprint/"><u>Minute Movie Narrative Blueprint</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/seamless-access-to-distant-linux-machine-files-made-simple/"><u>Seamless Access to Distant Linux Machine Files Made Simple</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/understanding-chipset-drivers-installation-guide-and-tips/"><u>Understanding Chipset Drivers: Installation Guide & Tips</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This gives users granular control over the song segments.</li><li>To create a song with Udio, users enter a prompt and select options such as genre, lyrics, and tags. The platform then generates two 30-sec track variations based on the input.</li><li>Users can extend these snippets, mix and match different extensions, and ultimately craft an epic track, potentially 15 minutes long.</li><li>You have tons of options categorized into basic and advanced settings for ease of use and accessibility.</li></ul><p> Udio is arguably one of the best AI music-generation tools out there. But beyond the quality of music it generates, I’m more impressed with how it provides tons of powerful features for users while keeping it as accessible as possible. Here’s a quick overview of the music generation experience with Udio.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.riaa.com/record-companies-bring-landmark-cases-for-responsible-ai-againstsuno-and-udio-in-boston-and-new-york-federal-courts-respectively/" >RIAA has filed copyright infringement cases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> against Udio and other AI music generation tools. At the time of writing, there’s no official verdict. As a measure of caution, I only use Udio for personal entertainment and not for commercial purposes.</p><h2 id="Build-Your-Epic-Track-30-Seconds-At-a-Time"><a href="#Build-Your-Epic-Track-30-Seconds-At-a-Time" class="headerlink" title="Build Your Epic Track 30 Seconds At a Time"></a>Build Your Epic Track 30 Seconds At a Time</h2><p> Udio’s approach to AI music creation is refreshingly granular. You start by entering your prompt (with or without specific instructions) in the input field and hit the “Create” button. Udio will take a few seconds and generate two 30-second song snippets based on your input. You can now extend these snippets, mix and match different extensions, and ultimately craft an epic track that could potentially stretch up to 15 minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1-udio-creation-tab-user-interface-overview.png"                      alt="Udio Creation Tab User Interface Overview"                > </p><p> This level of control sets Udio apart from other one-shot AI music generators. For example, with Suno, you get a complete two-minute track in one go—which, granted, you can extend or lengthen if you want. However, Udio lets you approach the song piece by piece, which gives you more control and creative expression.</p><p> Check out my <a class="link"   href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-select-15-professional-luts-to-boost-gopro-cinematography/" >guide on Suno <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you’re interested in a one-shot AI song generator.</p><h2 id="Udio-Holds-Your-Hand-as-You-Learn-to-Grow"><a href="#Udio-Holds-Your-Hand-as-You-Learn-to-Grow" class="headerlink" title="Udio Holds Your Hand as You Learn to Grow"></a>Udio Holds Your Hand as You Learn to Grow</h2><p> Udio’s granular approach to AI music generation offers you a wealth of options. While this might seem overwhelming at first, Udio’s intuitive interface makes creating songs a breeze. Let’s explore the basic and advanced controls you’ll use to craft your epic masterpiece.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Basic-Controls"><a href="#Basic-Controls" class="headerlink" title="Basic Controls"></a>Basic Controls</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3-udio-basic-controls-overview.png"                      alt="Udio Basic Controls Overview"                > </p><p> When you click on the input field, it expands into a square prompting space with multiple options. At the top, you can enter the prompt or hit the dice button on the left to generate a few random ideas. You can also upload an audio file as your base and use your prompt to steer the direction of the song.</p><p> Now, writing the prompt can be as simple as:</p><p><em>a song about the blog How To Geek</em></p><p> Udio will generate two 30-second tracks, automatically choosing genres like Electronic or Synthpop based on your prompt. However, if you want a specific genre, you can just add that to the prompt after commas:</p><p><em>a song about the blog how to geek, folk, moody</em> </p><p> In case you’re wondering, this is how the audio clip turned out:</p><p>Your browser does not support the video tag. </p><p> Also, based on your prompt, Udio will generate “Suggested Tags.” You can use these for inspiration if you can’t think of the right genre.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/5-a-look-at-udio-suggested-tags.png"                      alt="A look at Udio suggested tags"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134224/18498" target="_top" id="2134224">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134224" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134224/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Udio is programmed to auto-enhance your prompt to give you the best results—which can force it to not 100% adhere to your prompt. To disable auto-enhancement, enable “Manual Mode”—located above the “Suggested Tags.”</p><p> And finally, we have the “Lyrics” option. By default, it’s set to Auto-Generated using GPT-4o. The results are good enough, but if you want to use your own lyrics, switch to Custom mode.</p><p> If you are entering your custom lyrics, it’s not necessary to mention what the song is about when prompting. You can use the prompt input field to specify the genres and tags.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/6-udio-adding-custom-lyrics.png"                      alt="Udio adding Custom Lyrics"                > </p><p> Just remember that, since each snippet is just 30 seconds long, do not enter the entire song lyrics in Custom mode. Keep the lyrics short at 200–350 characters. Of course, if you don’t want any lyrics, you can just mark the section as “Instrumental.”</p><p> Udio typically starts generating from the middle of a song. As such, when entering custom lyrics, focus on the middle section. You can add intros and outros later by extending the track.</p><h3 id="Advanced-Features"><a href="#Advanced-Features" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Features"></a>Advanced Features</h3><p> While Udio’s basic controls are enough to get you started, the platform offers a set of advanced options for those looking to fine-tune their creations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7-udio-advanced-feaures-overview.png"                      alt="Udio Advanced Feaures overview"                > </p><p> Here’s a quick overview of each of the advanced controls and what they do:</p><ul><li><strong>Prompt Strength</strong>: Determines how closely Udio sticks to your prompt versus its natural style. Higher values prioritize your prompt, while lower values prioritize Udio’s default training and may stray from your idea.</li><li><strong>Lyrics Strength</strong>: Controls the lyrics’ influence on the sound. Again, higher strength equals closer adherence to your lyrics, which can reduce the natural (non-AI) sound of Udio, and vice versa.</li><li><strong>Seed (Manual Mode only)</strong>: Defines the content of a clip. Use the same seed number of an Udio track to reproduce the same style.</li><li><strong>Clip Start</strong>: Choose where in the full song context your 30-second clip begins. This allows you to start a track from the start instead of midway, which is the default behavior of Udio.</li><li><strong>Generation Quality</strong>: Balances quality with generation speed. Higher quality takes longer to generate.</li></ul><p> Remember, these advanced features require more experimentation—and, thereby, more credit consumption. Start with the default settings and only tweak if you’re not getting the desired sound. It’ll take time to master, but having such granular control is a game-changer when needed.</p><h2 id="Intuitive-Music-Extensions-and-Versioning-to-Organize-Your-Creations"><a href="#Intuitive-Music-Extensions-and-Versioning-to-Organize-Your-Creations" class="headerlink" title="Intuitive Music Extensions and Versioning to Organize Your Creations"></a>Intuitive Music Extensions and Versioning to Organize Your Creations</h2><p> After generating two 30-second tracks in Udio, pick a version you like and hit the Extend button. It’ll open up the prompting area with the track loaded and two new options—Crop and Extend and Extension Placement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/9-udio-track-extension-overview.png"                      alt="Udio Track Extension Overview"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983582">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983582.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983582">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983582.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983582%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983582/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> With the “Crop” and “Extend” option, you see the entire 30-second clip loaded into a waveform. You can drag to increase or decrease the red section and change its position to highlight where you want to add the new content. If you decide to place it in the middle, the new extension (with new lyrics or instruments) will be added in the middle of the original clip.</p><p> If you like the clip as is and just want to add a new section to the track, then use the “Extension Placement” option. It lets you decide where you want to add an intro, outro, or a section before or after the selected track.</p><p> You are free to mix and match these options creatively. For example, you can extend a track by adding an outro and then extend the track further with a new section. This is particularly useful when switching genres on a track.</p><p> After picking where you wish to add the new section, click on the “Extend” button to generate two extensions. Now, to help you find your extensions, Udio uses a nested version naming system.</p><ul><li>Original extension: [Song Name] ext V1 or V2</li><li>Further extensions: [Song Name] ext V2.1 or V2.2</li><li>Additional extensions: [Song Name] ext V2.2.1 or V2.2.2</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/10-udio-extensions-tracks-naming-convention.png"                      alt="Udio Extensions Tracks naming convention"                > </p><p> Alternatively, you can also click on the Show Generation Tree button. Udio will organize all extensions in a collapsible drop-down tree structure so you know exactly which tracks got extended to build the full track.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/11-udio-track-generation-tree-overview.png"                      alt="Udio Track Generation Tree Overview"                > </p><p> Here’s a listen to the whole song created by combining all the track extensions:</p><p>Your browser does not support the video tag. </p><h2 id="Audio-Inpainting-to-Fine-Tune-How-Everything-Sounds"><a href="#Audio-Inpainting-to-Fine-Tune-How-Everything-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="Audio Inpainting to Fine Tune How Everything Sounds"></a>Audio Inpainting to Fine Tune How Everything Sounds</h2><p> Let’s say you like a track or snippet generated by Udio, but there is a small error or issue. Well, instead of regenerating the entire track, you can use audio inpainting to fix it. The tool is particularly useful for:</p><ul><li>Correcting pronunciation errors</li><li>Fixing misspelled lyrics</li><li>Removing unwanted sounds or glitches</li><li>Making minor adjustments to specific parts of a song</li></ul><p> You can also use Audio Inpainting to change the entire verse or chorus while keeping the same melody and vocal style. However, the results can be iffy when making large changes using this method.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/13-udio-audio-imprinting-overview.png"                      alt="Udio Audio Imprinting Overview"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098701/14409" target="_top" id="2098701">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098701" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098701/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Now, here’s a quick step-by-step guide on using Audio Inpainting:</p><ol><li>Click the three-dot options menu next to your selected track, then click “Inpaint Track.”</li><li>In the prompting window, specify a 28-second context window. This helps Udio maintain consistency in style, tone, and vocals in your inpainted section.</li><li>Within the context window, select up to four smaller sections from the audio waveform to specify where you want to make the edits.</li><li>In the lyrics section, mark the area you wish to modify by placing three stars (***) before and after the relevant text.  <ol><li>I have marked the first verse as I want to change the lyrics from “With each keystroke, we fend off the gray” to “With each keystroke, we fend off the blue screen of death”</li></ol></li><li>After making the desired changes, click the “Inpaint” button to generate two new track variations with the inpainted parts.</li></ol><p> For reference, here is the inpainted track. You can compare it with the previous track and see that at the 45-50 second mark, the lyrics have changed from saying “…gray” to “…blue screen of death”.</p><p>Your browser does not support the video tag. </p><hr><p> Udio stands out in the AI music generation landscape with its granular approach paired with a user-friendly interface.

One way to optimize your PC is by updating drivers. While many of us keep our graphics card drivers up-to-date, we tend to overlook chipset drivers. Let’s explore what they are, why they’re important, and how to update them.</p><h2 id="What-Are-Chipset-Drivers"><a href="#What-Are-Chipset-Drivers" class="headerlink" title="What Are Chipset Drivers?"></a>What Are Chipset Drivers?</h2><p> A <a class="link"   href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-effortless-storytelling-using-pixiz-for-photo-videos/" >chipset is a set of chips integrated into your motherboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> responsible for handling communication between different components inside your computer. Some call the chipset your computer’s “glue.” It controls parts like your RAM, storage, and USB slots, but it also manages data flow and voltage regulation. In practical terms, your chipset determines whether you can <a class="link"   href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/change-location-on-yik-yak-for-your-honor-x50-to-enjoy-more-fun-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >overclock your RAM and CPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, assuming the parts are unlocked for overclocking. For instance, AMD A-series chipsets traditionally don’t allow for manual overclocking.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/increase-your-savings-with-a-huge-80-off-the-elegoo-neptune-plus-ideal-for-big-prints/" >Chipset drivers are a type of software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allows your chipset to communicate effectively with your operating system. Drivers are often referred to as “translators.” Without any chipset drivers, your computer wouldn’t work correctly; the operating system wouldn’t be able to detect all of your computer parts, and you would probably face stability issues. All operating systems auto-detect and install chipset drivers in the background to ensure everything works correctly, and you’re none the wiser that it ever happened.</p><p> However, just because your operating system has installed the chipset drivers doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re the right ones. You should still go out of your way to update to the latest version.</p><h2 id="Why-Chipset-Driver-Updates-Matter"><a href="#Why-Chipset-Driver-Updates-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Why Chipset Driver Updates Matter"></a>Why Chipset Driver Updates Matter</h2><p> Truth be told, you don’t <em>have to</em> install the latest chipset drivers, but there are a few good reasons why you should. For starters, installing chipset drivers improves compatibility. New models of NVMe SSDs, RAM, and other components come out all the time. <a class="link"   href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/running-state-of-the-art-ai-windows-edition/" >Updating to the latest BIOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is only one side of the equation—you also need the latest chipset drivers to ensure every component works correctly. Unlike BIOS updates, chipset updates are risk-free and entirely done within the operating system.</p><p> More importantly, updated chipset drivers improve security, stability, and performance. Look at any chipset driver release notes, and you’ll likely see “bug fixes,” along with other minor improvements. While chipset drivers don’t necessarily increase your average FPS, they can slightly reduce random stutters by <a class="link"   href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/discover-the-ultimate-selection-of-great-sports-flicks-available-today/" >improving 1% and 0.1% lows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This is because the updated drivers optimize how your CPU, RAM, storage, and other parts communicate.</p><p> Updating chipset drivers can also bring support for new programs and features. A great example is Ryzen’s power plans, which slightly improve performance by fixing Windows CPU usage on older Ryzen CPUs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-12-06_13h33_26-transformed.png"                      alt="The Windows 10 power plan with the AMD Ryzen Balanced plan selected."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098702/14409" target="_top" id="2098702">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098702" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098702/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Update-Your-Chipset-Drivers"><a href="#How-to-Update-Your-Chipset-Drivers" class="headerlink" title="How to Update Your Chipset Drivers"></a>How to Update Your Chipset Drivers</h2><p> To update your chipset drivers, start by identifying your motherboard chipset. The chipset is in the first part of your motherboard’s model name—for instance, I have a Gigabyte B450M DS3H motherboard, so my chipset is the B450.</p><p> If you don’t know your motherboard’s model name, you can quickly check by opening the Start Menu, searching for “System Information,” and clicking the app. You’ll see the motherboard manufacturer and model name next to “BaseBoard Manufacturer” and “BaseBoard Product.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-12-06_14h25_59.png"                      alt="Windows&#39; System Information menu with information detailing the motherboard manufacturer and model name."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977020">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977020.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977020">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977020.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977020%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977020/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you’re on AMD, you can grab the chipset drivers either from the motherboard manufacturer or <a class="link"   href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/" >AMD’s support website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> directly. I recommend going to AMD’s website because they’ll always have the latest version available. On AMD Drivers and Support, search for your chipset or select Chipsets &gt; Your CPU Socket &gt; Your Chipset. Download and install the drivers, then restart your computer.</p><p> If you’re on Intel, there’s a good chance that Windows has already downloaded and installed the optimal drivers for your chipset. But there’s no reason why you shouldn’t try installing the latest drivers anyway. <a class="link"   href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/search.html?ws=text#sort=relevancy&layout=table&f:@tabfilter=[Downloads]&f:@stm%5F10385%5Fen=[Chipsets]" >Intel’s Driver Support website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> doesn’t have any chipset drivers, but rather a Chipset INF Utility that gives the operating system the name of the chipset, which isn’t of much practical use. Instead, you should go to your motherboard manufacturer’s website, find your exact motherboard model, open the support page, and download the latest chipset drivers from there. Install the drivers, restart your system, and you’re done.</p><p> Since chipset drivers don’t update automatically, manually check for updates every few months to keep your system up-to-date.</p><hr><p> Congratulations on updating your chipset drivers! You can now get the most out of your hardware and you might have even unlocked exciting new features.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-a-beginners-guide-to-ios-screen-recording-for-2024/"><u>[New] A Beginner's Guide to iOS Screen Recording for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-your-content-strategy-with-social-blade-and-youtube-stats-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Your Content Strategy with Social Blade and YouTube Stats for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-maximum-capacity-choices-ultimate-cloud-service-list/"><u>[Updated] Maximum Capacity Choices Ultimate Cloud Service List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/approved-the-pinnacle-selector-your-personal-video-vault/"><u>2024 Approved The Pinnacle Selector Your Personal Video Vault</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/a-perfect-guide-to-remove-or-disable-google-smart-lock-on-motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Perfect Guide To Remove or Disable Google Smart Lock On Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/download-the-latest-hp-m45n-pro-452dn-device-driver-for-free/"><u>Download the Latest HP M45n Pro 452Dn Device Driver for Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-the-j5-tactical-v1-pro-rugged-design-for-optimal-low-light-conditions/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of the J5 Tactical V1-Pro – Rugged Design for Optimal Low-Light Conditions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/mastering-technology-trends-guided-by-toms-hardware-professionals/"><u>Mastering Technology Trends - Guided by Tom's Hardware Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/next-generation-search-evolves-as-alphabet-and-microsoft-prepare-to-unveil-ai-powered-web-query-innovations-similar-to-chatgpt/"><u>Next Generation Search Evolves as Alphabet and Microsoft Prepare to Unveil AI-Powered Web Query Innovations Similar to ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/orbital-odyssey-interrupted-how-boeings-stranded-astronauts-could-hitch-a-ride-with-competitor-spacex/"><u>Orbital Odyssey Interrupted: How Boeing's Stranded Astronauts Could Hitch a Ride with Competitor SpaceX</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/proton-introduces-new-bitcoin-compatible-wallet-feature/"><u>Proton Introduces New Bitcoin-Compatible Wallet Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/rekindling-interest-in-cds-and-dvds-through-innovative-disc-advancements/"><u>Rekindling Interest in CDs and DVDs Through Innovative Disc Advancements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/resolving-the-unprocessable-entity-issue-in-chatbot-interactions/"><u>Resolving the 'Unprocessable Entity' Issue in Chatbot Interactions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/revolutionary-3d-ink-requires-just-saltwater-no-light-or-heat-needed/"><u>Revolutionary 3D Ink Requires Just Saltwater: No Light or Heat Needed</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unleash-the-Power-of-CrossOver-24-on-Mac-Linux-for-Free-Optimize-Your-PC-Apps-Today-at-a-Sale-Price"><a href="#Unleash-the-Power-of-CrossOver-24-on-Mac-Linux-for-Free-Optimize-Your-PC-Apps-Today-at-a-Sale-Price" class="headerlink" title="Unleash the Power of CrossOver 24 on Mac &amp; Linux for Free - Optimize Your PC Apps Today at a Sale Price"></a>Unleash the Power of CrossOver 24 on Mac &amp; Linux for Free - Optimize Your PC Apps Today at a Sale Price</h2><p>CrossOver is a popular compatibility layer for Windows applications on Mac, Linux, and Chromebooks, based on the Wine project. CrossOver 24 has just been released, with some great usability improvements and significant upgrades to app and game compatibility.</p><p> CrossOver 24 is <a class="link"   href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-quick-tips-to-produce-quality-thumbnails-fast/" >based on Wine 9.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which brings over 7,000 changes aimed at improving a variety of applications. It also contains Wine Mono 8.1.0, vkd3d 1.10, and MoltenVK 1.2.5, with the latter two designed to help run more games and 3D-accelerated applications. CodeWeavers specifically mentions Planet Zoo, the Warframe standalone launcher, Mafia: Definitive Edition, and Horizon Zero Dawn as some newly-compatible games, and the latest installers for Microsoft Office 365 applications now work (as long as you use the 32-bit online installers).</p><p> The CrossOver team has also included several highly-requested UI updates in this release. You can now drag and drop executables into CrossOver to run or install them, which is particularly useful for standalone Windows applications that can be run without installation. You can also save commands as a launcher on Mac or create a launcher on Linux. This action creates a launcher icon for the selected executable in your bottle.</p><p> CrossOver 24 also now allows users to change the directory where their bottles are stored. This feature is a boon for users who wish to store large Windows applications on an external drive. This new setting can be accessed from the CrossOver &gt; Settings menu on Mac and Preferences on Linux.</p><p> CodeWeavers said in a blog post, “CrossOver 24 is just the beginning of what our team has planned for this year.

Last month, the company introduced an optional <a class="link"   href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-for-implementing-look-up-tables-in-creative-suite/" >pop-up survey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that’s triggered when installing Chrome from Edge. Now, Windows users are being hit with a <em>mandatory</em> survey when they try to <em>close</em> OneDrive.</p><h3 id="UPDATE-2023-11-10-10-11-EST-BY-ANDREW-HEINZMAN"><a href="#UPDATE-2023-11-10-10-11-EST-BY-ANDREW-HEINZMAN" class="headerlink" title="UPDATE: 2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;10 10:11 EST BY ANDREW HEINZMAN"></a>UPDATE: 2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;10 10:11 EST BY ANDREW HEINZMAN</h3><p><strong><em>Statement from Microsoft</em></strong> </p><p> In a statement to <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/8/23952878/microsoft-onedrive-windows-close-app-notification" >The Verge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Microsoft explains that “a small subset of consumer OneDrive users” were shown the OneDrive survey between the dates of November 1st and November 8th. The survey is, presumably, done.</p><p> The survey pop-up, which was first noticed by <a class="link"   href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-wont-let-you-close-onedrive-in-windows-without-you-explaining-it-first/" >Neowin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, warns that data cannot be synced to the cloud when OneDrive is closed. On its own, this warning may be useful to some people, as Microsoft doesn’t provide a clear-cut “quit” button for the OneDrive application. To close OneDrive, you need to right-click the OneDrive icon in your system tray, click the settings cog that shows up in the OneDrive panel, and select “pause syncing.” You can also kill OneDrive in the Task Manager, but in any case, it’s hard to tell when you’re actually quitting the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/11-1.png"                      alt="The &quot;quit OneDrive&quot; popup prompting a user to complete a survey."                > </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-wont-let-you-close-onedrive-in-windows-without-you-explaining-it-first/" >Neowin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> A warning is fine, and this particular warning has been around for a while. But the new survey dropdown forces users to “select a reason for quitting OneDrive.” Here are the answers you’re allowed to choose from:</p><ul><li>I don’t want OneDrive running all the time</li><li>I don’t know what OneDrive is</li><li>I don’t use OneDrive</li><li>I’m trying to fix a problem with OneDrive</li><li>I’m trying to speed up my computer</li><li>I get too many notifications</li><li>Other</li></ul><p> Honestly, OneDrive is a pretty solid cloud storage solution, especially for those who regularly use Teams, Word, and other Microsoft applications. The problem is that all Windows users are forced to interact with OneDrive—it opens automatically during startup, it’s hard to close, and it has this new mandatory survey. If you uninstall OneDrive, it may be reinstalled during a future Windows update. And if that’s not enough, Windows 11 will <a class="link"   href="https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-windows-11-ads-start-menu-365-onedrive-badgin-1850343412" >show you ads for OneDrive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. By the way, you can <a class="link"   href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/get-clarity-back-in-photos-how-to-repair-iphone-camera-focusing-problems/" >change OneDrive’s startup behavior <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the Task Manager.</p><p> The new survey appears in OneDrive version 23.214.1015.0001, per Neowin. We had trouble replicating the survey on our Windows PCs, which may indicate it’s part of a rollout that isn’t complete.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-wont-let-you-close-onedrive-in-windows-without-you-explaining-it-first/" >Neowin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-sudden-tiktok-reset-restoring-your-content/"><u>[New] Sudden TikTok Reset Restoring Your Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-tweets-adding-media-files-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing Tweets Adding Media Files for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-google-pixels-audio-landscape/"><u>2024 Approved Exploring Google Pixel's Audio Landscape</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-technique-for-merging-gopro-videography-with-encompassing-immersive-content/"><u>2024 Approved Top Technique for Merging GoPro Videography with Encompassing Immersive Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unfortunately-contacts-has-stopped-error-on-nokia-c12-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix Unfortunately, Contacts Has Stopped Error on Nokia C12 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-craft-engaging-titlescaptions-with-microsofts-photos-app-win-11/"><u>In 2024, Craft Engaging Titles/Captions with Microsoft's Photos App (Win 11)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/overcoming-usb-connectivity-problems-in-windows-when-new-devices-go-undetected/"><u>Overcoming USB Connectivity Problems in Windows When New Devices Go Undetected</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-to-substituting-characters-with-line-breaks-using-notepadplusplus/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide to Substituting Characters with Line Breaks Using Notepad++</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-installing-iso-files-on-pcs-with-windows-7810/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide: Installing ISO Files on PCs with Windows 7/8/10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-launching-admin-command-prompt-on-windows-10/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide: Launching Admin Command Prompt on Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/streamlined-network-card-driver-tweaks-in-win7/"><u>Streamlined Network Card Driver Tweaks in Win7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/struggling-with-crusader-kings-2-startup-issues-find-helpful-solutions-below/"><u>Struggling with Crusader Kings 2 Startup Issues?

I never skip installing any of these updates because doing so can cause numerous problems.</p><p> Without timely security patches, my device could be more exposed to malware. The existing bugs that make my system unstable would continue to bother me, and without performance-optimizing updates, my system won’t perform as well as it might otherwise.

That’s a User Account Control (UAC) prompt. It acts as a checkpoint to prevent users or malicious software from making changes to system settings and files without the consent of the device’s administrator.</p><p> If malware gets into your device, it can’t make changes beyond what a non-administrator user can, meaning no serious infiltration of system settings. When a third-party program requests administrative privileges through the UAC window, it warns you to be cautious.
