That being said, it’s a practical feature to have access to for those times when there’s no macOS version of a particular iPhone app you’d like to use, like Instagram or Apple’s own Fitness app, or it plain sucks to use, like Twitter.</p><p> iPhone Mirroring supports Apple Silicon Macs and Intel-based models equipped with Apple’s T2 Security chip. <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-the-first-timers-blueprint-for-youtube-income-for-2024/" >Your iPhone and Mac must support Continuity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on, use the same Apple ID with two-factor authentication enabled, and be physically nearby.</p><h2 id="Responding-to-iOS-Notifications-Has-Reclaimed-My-Time"><a href="#Responding-to-iOS-Notifications-Has-Reclaimed-My-Time" class="headerlink" title="Responding to iOS Notifications Has Reclaimed My Time"></a>Responding to iOS Notifications Has Reclaimed My Time</h2><p> I’m too lazy to pick up my iPhone while using my desktop writing station.

Thankfully, that’s not the case. Although iPhone Mirroring doesn’t support the iPhone’s Notification Center, Control Center, and Siri; all iOS notifications are integrated directly into your Mac’s Notification Center alongside native macOS notifications.</p><p> You can respond to any iPhone notification right there, and clicking it opens the right iPhone app in iPhone Mirroring.</p><p> Press the Command + 1 keyboard shortcut in the iPhone Mirroring window to reach the iPhone’s Home Screen or Command + 2 to invoke the iOS app switcher. The Command + 3 shortcut will bring up Spotlight Search (use it as a quick app launcher).</p><h2 id="Drag-and-Drop-From-Mac-to-iPhone-Soon"><a href="#Drag-and-Drop-From-Mac-to-iPhone-Soon" class="headerlink" title="Drag and Drop From Mac to iPhone (Soon)"></a>Drag and Drop From Mac to iPhone (Soon)</h2><p> I wish I could tell you how awesome dragging and dropping various items between my iPhone and Mac is.

This is enhancing the overall text effect thanks to the dynamic movement of the elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/3d-cool-gold-intro.jpg"                      alt="3d cool gold intro"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139120/17108" target="_top" id="2139120">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139120" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139120/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-Free-Storm-Intro-Template-1"><a href="#9-Free-Storm-Intro-Template-1" class="headerlink" title="9.

The lightning and storm effect is one of the most demanding intro templates. The overall effect is somewhat dark but that is what you expect in a stormy environment.</p><p>The characters of the titles have the stone texture in 3D mode. They have their individual spinning animation. The lightning effect on the title along with the stormy background is truly impactful.

Thereafter, it creates an impactful transition from slow to sudden shock motion. All the while the background has shooting stars that adds to the overall animation.</p><p>The title is in 3D texture. A graphical object in the shape of the planetary ring has been used for enhancing the effect. Along with those, there is the light dispersion and blurry effect that makes the text stand out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/dynamic-blue-intro-template.jpg"                      alt="dynamic blue intro template"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Alternative-Way-to-Make-Intro-Video-1"><a href="#Part-2-Alternative-Way-to-Make-Intro-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Discover-Enhanced-Productivity-with-Windows-11’S-Updated-Sticky-Notes-Feature"><a href="#Discover-Enhanced-Productivity-with-Windows-11’S-Updated-Sticky-Notes-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Discover Enhanced Productivity with Windows 11’S Updated Sticky Notes Feature"></a>Discover Enhanced Productivity with Windows 11’S Updated Sticky Notes Feature</h2><p>The Sticky Notes application in Windows is a great way to quickly write notes that stay on your desktop and (if you want) synchronize with your mobile devices. Microsoft is now testing a revamped version of Sticky Notes based on its OneNote service.</p><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-swiftly-craft-custom-thumbnails-for-youtube-shorts-with-these-hacks/" >current Sticky Notes app in Windows 10 and 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is fairly basic, but it works well enough, and you can even choose to synchronize notes with your Microsoft account. That allows the notes you created to appear in the Outlook web app, Microsoft Teams, and the Microsoft 365 mobile app. Microsoft announced a new Sticky Notes app on its Microsoft 365 Insider Blog, which is “focused on creating and recalling notes more seamlessly than ever.” </p><p> The main difference with the new Sticky Notes is that it’s built around Microsoft’s OneNote application. It’s accessible from the new “Sticky Notes” button in the OneNote toolbar, or from the existing Win+Alt+S keyboard shortcut. Microsoft says you’ll also be able to pin it to the taskbar after opening, but it’s unclear if it will appear in the Start Menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sticky-notes_5-anim.gif"                      alt="Screen recording of creating a note in Sticky Notes from a PowerPoint screenshot."                > </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://insider.microsoft365.com/en-us/blog/introducing-the-new-sticky-notes-app-for-windows" >Microsoft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The new Sticky Notes can create text notes, just like the earlier version, but it also has a new Screenshot button that saves the current window along with its source. For example, clicking the Screenshot button while you have a PowerPoint presentation open will save the entire window, the name of the presentation, and the application icon in the note. If the note is a screenshot of a website, clicking it will open the original page. Your notes appear in the Sticky Notes list, the OneNote app on Windows, or the OneNote app on mobile devices.</p><p> The updated application looks impressive, but it also completely removes the sticky notes aesthetic that has stuck around since <a class="link"   href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-easy-ways-to-copy-contacts-from-samsung-galaxy-a14-5g-to-iphone-14-and-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/" >the original version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on Windows XP Tablet Edition and Windows Vista.

It sounds easy, but it isn’t—Connections categories can be almost anything, and they’re usually quite specific. If you need a hand getting the answers, we’ve got you covered.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134223/18498" target="_top" id="2134223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134223/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-Connections"><a href="#What-Is-Connections" class="headerlink" title="What Is Connections?"></a>What Is Connections?</h2><p> Connections is a game from the New York Times. The objective is simple: sort 16 words into groups of 4. Each group of words will be connected by some common idea or theme. That common element could be anything. We have seen everything from games that rely on the number of letters in the words to categories that require you to spot an extra letter at the end of the word. Sometimes they’re references to economics, other times they reference fairy tales. There is no telling what sort of association there will be between words.</p><p> Once you’re confident you understand the connection, select 4 words, then hit “Submit.” You have only four attempts in total, so don’t be too guess-happy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139109/17108" target="_top" id="2139109">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139109" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139109/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Hints-for-Today’s-Connections-Groups"><a href="#Hints-for-Today’s-Connections-Groups" class="headerlink" title="Hints for Today’s Connections Groups"></a>Hints for Today’s Connections Groups</h2><p> Here are a few hints for the 381st Connections game to get you started:</p><ul><li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Military hierarchy.</li><li><strong>Green:</strong> The other end of a USB cable or power cable.</li><li><strong>Blue:</strong> When there is interest in something.</li><li><strong>Purple:</strong> For when you want to sell something or solicit a service.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/june-26th-connections.png"                      alt="The words for June 26th&#39;s connections game."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111982/7443" target="_top" id="2111982">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111982" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111982/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you still need help, the actual group names are:</p><ul><li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Army Ranks</li><li><strong>Green:</strong> Place to Plug Something In</li><li><strong>Blue:</strong> Consumer Desire, Collectively</li><li><strong>Purple:</strong> ____ Ad</li></ul><h2 id="Today’s-NYT-Connections-Answers"><a href="#Today’s-NYT-Connections-Answers" class="headerlink" title="Today’s NYT Connections Answers"></a>Today’s NYT Connections Answers</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/june-26th-connections-filled.png"                      alt="June 26th Connections words sorted into groups."                > </p><p><strong>Army Ranks (Yellow):</strong> </p><p> Captain, General, Major, Private</p><p><strong>Place to Plug Something In (Green):</strong> </p><p> Jack, Outlet, Port, Socket</p><p><strong>Consumer Desire, Collectively (Blue):</strong> </p><p> Appetite, Audience, Demand, Market</p><p><strong>_____ Ad (Purple):</strong> </p><p> Attack, Personal, Pop-up, Want</p><h2 id="How-Did-We-Solve-This-Connections-Game"><a href="#How-Did-We-Solve-This-Connections-Game" class="headerlink" title="How Did We Solve This Connections Game?"></a>How Did We Solve This Connections Game?</h2><p> June 26th was an average game.</p><p> Skimming the words, the words captain, general, major, and private all just struck me as likely related, since they’re army ranks. The Yellow group was literally just named “Army Ranks.”</p><p> The next word I picked up was outlet. Outlet most commonly refers to the apparatus on the wall that you plug things into, so I went looking for other words that have things plugged into them. Port (like an ethernet or USB port), a jack (like a audio jack), and socket all fit that idea quite nicely, so I stuck them in a group together. They were Green, “Place to Plug Something In.”</p><p> Appetite, audience, demand, and market are all terms related to what consumers want. “There is a market for a tool like that” or “There isn’t enough demand to justify making a product like that” are examples of how you might see them used. In any case, the connection was pretty straight forward. The Blue was “Consumer Desire, Collectively.”</p><p> That left attack, personal, pop-up, and want in Purple. After considering it for a few minutes, I eventually realized these were types of advertisements on might see on the Internet. The purple group’s name was “____ Ad,” which seemed unusually direct for Purple.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918679/19272" target="_top" id="1918679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918679/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-You-Guess-Connections-Groups"><a href="#How-Do-You-Guess-Connections-Groups" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Guess Connections Groups?"></a>How Do You Guess Connections Groups?</h2><p> There is no quick, reliable way to approach Connections like there is with Wordle, since Connections isn’t algorithmic. However, there are a few things to keep in mind that can help.</p><ol><li><strong>Look for similar parts of speech</strong>. Are some words verbs and others nouns? Are some adjectives? Try mentally grouping them based on those categories and see if any other patterns jump out at you.</li><li><strong>Are the words synonyms?</strong> Sometimes categories will just be synonyms for a phrase, or very close to synonyms. Don’t rely too closely on this, though. Occasionally, Connections will deliberately throw in words that are <em>sometimes</em> synonyms to mislead you.</li><li><strong>Try saying the words.</strong> Sometimes, saying the words helps. One puzzle we saw included the words go, rate, faster, clip, pace, speed, move, commute, and hurry—all of which are obviously related to the idea of motion. However, when you say them, it becomes a little more obvious that only four (go, move, hurry, faster) are things you’d actually say to prompt someone to get moving.</li><li><strong>Expect the <a class="link"   href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/red%20herring" >red herring <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</strong> Connections usually has words that could be plausibly, yet incorrectly, grouped together. Take the words Bud, Corona, and Light, as an example. You might instinctively see those three words together and assume they’re lumped together in a category related to beer—but they weren’t.</li><li><strong>Look for distinct words.</strong> If a word on your board doesn’t have multiple meanings or can really only be used in one context, try using that word as the basis for a category.</li><li><strong>Shuffle the board.</strong> Sometimes, moving words around will help you look at them in new ways.</li></ol><p> If you didn’t solve this one, don’t feel too bad—there’s always tomorrow! And those words may align with a topic you’re interested in, giving you a leg up on the competition.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-drone-buying-basics-must-know-points-before-shopping/"><u>[New] Drone Buying Basics Must-Know Points Before Shopping</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-innovation-in-action-youtube-split-screen-techniques/"><u>[New] Innovation in Action YouTube Split-Screen Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-the-complete-guide-to-enhancing-tiktok-bio-with-linktree/"><u>[New] The Complete Guide to Enhancing TikTok Bio with Linktree</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-premium-mac-graphics-collector/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Premium Mac Graphics Collector</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-sonic-social-media-merging-melodies-and-memes-on-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Sonic Social Media Merging Melodies and Memes on Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-newly-updated-set-of-chat-starters-for-podcast-success/"><u>2024 Approved Newly Updated Set of Chat Starters for Podcast Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-heart-of-filmora-10-engaging-editing-capabilities/"><u>2024 Approved The Heart of Filmora 10 Engaging Editing Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/amd-driver-updates-made-simple-how-to-secure-blockchain-functionality-on-your-desktop/"><u>AMD Driver Updates Made Simple: How to Secure Blockchain Functionality on Your Desktop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/effortless-methods-for-transforming-mp3-files-into-flac-format-desktop-and-web-options/"><u>Effortless Methods for Transforming MP3 Files Into FLAC Format: Desktop and Web Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-reset-a-realme-11-pro-phone-that-is-locked-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How to Reset a Realme 11 Pro Phone That Is Locked | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-mobile-vr-experiences-the-leading-10-headsets/"><u>In 2024, Top Mobile VR Experiences - The Leading 10 Headsets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-list-of-mac-friendly-video-to-mp4-codecs/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate List of Mac-Friendly Video to MP4 Codecs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-varied-and-eye-catching-vlog-discussion-points/"><u>In 2024, Varied and Eye-Catching Vlog Discussion Points</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/leading-the-vr-charge-top-10-pc-headsets-for-2024/"><u>Leading The VR Charge Top 10 PC Headsets for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

We have seen everything from games that rely on the number of letters in the words to categories that require you to spot an extra letter at the end of the word. Sometimes they’re references to economics, other times they reference fairy tales. There is no telling what sort of association there will be between words.</p><p> Once you’re confident you understand the connection, select 4 words, then hit “Submit.” You have only four attempts in total, so don’t be too guess-happy.</p><h2 id="Hints-for-Today’s-Connections-Groups"><a href="#Hints-for-Today’s-Connections-Groups" class="headerlink" title="Hints for Today’s Connections Groups"></a>Hints for Today’s Connections Groups</h2><p> Here are a few hints for the 376th Connections game to get you started:</p><ul><li><strong>Yellow:</strong> A way of having fun.</li><li><strong>Green:</strong> When you say yes.</li><li><strong>Blue:</strong> When the person starting at a disadvantage does well.</li><li><strong>Purple:</strong> An annoying driving occurence</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/june-21st-connections.png"                      alt="June 21st Connections and words."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139107/17108" target="_top" id="2139107">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139107" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139107/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you still need help, the actual group names are:</p><ul><li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Amusement Park Rides</li><li><strong>Green:</strong> Approval</li><li><strong>Blue:</strong> Types of Come-From-Behind Stories</li><li><strong>Purple:</strong> Beginning With Synonyms for Rear End</li></ul><h2 id="Today’s-NYT-Connections-Answers"><a href="#Today’s-NYT-Connections-Answers" class="headerlink" title="Today’s NYT Connections Answers"></a>Today’s NYT Connections Answers</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/june-21st-connections-filled.png"                      alt="June 21st Connections groups and words."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484939/16446" target="_top" id="1484939">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484939" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484939/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Amusement Park Rides (Yellow):</strong> </p><p> Ferris Wheel, Merry-Go-Round, Roller Coaster, Tilt-A-Whirl</p><p><strong>Approval (Green):</strong> </p><p> Clearance, Go-Ahead, Green Light, Thumbs-Up</p><p><strong>Types of Come-From-Behind Stories (Blue):</strong> </p><p> Cinderella, David-And-Goliath, Rags-To-Riches, Underdog</p><p><strong>Beginning With Synonyms For Read End (Purple):</strong> </p><p> Bumper-to-Bumper, Buttermilk, Rumpelstiltskin, Tailgate </p><h2 id="How-Did-We-Solve-This-Connections-Game"><a href="#How-Did-We-Solve-This-Connections-Game" class="headerlink" title="How Did We Solve This Connections Game?"></a>How Did We Solve This Connections Game?</h2><p> June 21st was pretty average.</p><p> The first word I latched on to was underdog. That immediately got me thinking about comeback stories, and from there, it was easy to pick out Cinderella, David-and-Goliath, and rags-to-riches. Blue was just “Types of Come-From-Behind Stories.” </p><p> Ferris Wheel. It is unambiguously a type of carnival or amusement park ride, so I went looking for other things that you might find at such events. I settled on merry-go-round, roller coaster, and tilt-a-whirl. Yellow was “Amusement Park Rides.” </p><p> Green Light means to approve something, so I went looking for other expressions that could mean the same thing. Go-ahead is a pretty direct synonym, and so is thumbs-up. Clearance is <em>slightly</em> different, but it is used in much the same way, so I threw it into the group I was going to guess. That was the Green group, “Approval.” </p><p> That left bumper-to-bumper, buttermilk, Rumpelstiltskin, and tailgate. Bumper-to-bumper and tailgate are terms I associated with driving, so I was trying to make some connection there, but for the life of me I couldn’t see how. It turns out the group was “Beginning with Synonyms for Rear End.” I probably would have stared at that one for a long time before it occurred to me. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012406/19272" target="_top" id="2012406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-You-Guess-Connections-Groups"><a href="#How-Do-You-Guess-Connections-Groups" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Guess Connections Groups?"></a>How Do You Guess Connections Groups?</h2><p> There is no quick, reliable way to approach Connections like there is with Wordle, since Connections isn’t algorithmic. However, there are a few things to keep in mind that can help.</p><ol><li><strong>Look for similar parts of speech</strong>. Are some words verbs and others nouns? Are some adjectives? Try mentally grouping them based on those categories and see if any other patterns jump out at you.</li><li><strong>Are the words synonyms?</strong> Sometimes categories will just be synonyms for a phrase, or very close to synonyms. Don’t rely too closely on this, though. Occasionally, Connections will deliberately throw in words that are <em>sometimes</em> synonyms to mislead you.</li><li><strong>Try saying the words.</strong> Sometimes, saying the words helps. One puzzle we saw included the words go, rate, faster, clip, pace, speed, move, commute, and hurry—all of which are obviously related to the idea of motion. However, when you say them, it becomes a little more obvious that only four (go, move, hurry, faster) are things you’d actually say to prompt someone to get moving.</li><li><strong>Expect the <a class="link"   href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/red%20herring" >red herring <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</strong> Connections usually has words that could be plausibly, yet incorrectly, grouped together. Take the words Bud, Corona, and Light, as an example. You might instinctively see those three words together and assume they’re lumped together in a category related to beer—but they weren’t.</li><li><strong>Look for distinct words.</strong> If a word on your board doesn’t have multiple meanings or can really only be used in one context, try using that word as the basis for a category.</li><li><strong>Shuffle the board.</strong> Sometimes, moving words around will help you look at them in new ways.</li></ol><p> If you didn’t solve this one, don’t feel too bad—there’s always tomorrow! And those words may align with a topic you’re interested in, giving you a leg up on the competition.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-advanced-palette-tweaks-by-professionals/"><u>[New] Advanced Palette Tweaks by Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-unlock-your-social-media-superpowers-top-9-instagram-techniques-to-skyrocket-popularity/"><u>[New] Unlock Your Social Media Superpowers Top 9 Instagram Techniques to Skyrocket Popularity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-no-fuss-guide-for-exploring-loved-and-trending-youtube-comments/"><u>[Updated] The No-Fuss Guide for Exploring Loved and Trending YouTube Comments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-transforming-mundane-interviews-into-memorable-experienrances/"><u>[Updated] Transforming Mundane Interviews Into Memorable Experienrances</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-securing-your-digital-footprint-when-leaving-discord/"><u>2024 Approved Securing Your Digital Footprint When Leaving Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/comprehensive-evaluation-of-photoscape-your-go-to-source-for-costless-picture-editing-tools/"><u>Comprehensive Evaluation of PhotoScape: Your Go-To Source for Costless Picture Editing Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/error-404-unable-to-locate-webpage-solutions-from-digiarty/"><u>Error 404: Unable to Locate Webpage - Solutions From DigiArty</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-unfortunately-settings-has-stopped-on-oppo-a79-5g-quickly-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix Unfortunately Settings Has Stopped on Oppo A79 5G Quickly | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-ways-to-track-oppo-a38-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 3 Ways to Track Oppo A38 without Them Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-soundtrack-of-stills-visual-audio-crafting/"><u>In 2024, The Soundtrack of Stills Visual-Audio Crafting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-converting-speech-to-text-with-google-docs/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Converting Speech to Text with Google Docs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/mastering-android-device-manager-the-ultimate-guide-to-unlocking-your-realme-narzo-n53-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>Mastering Android Device Manager The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Your Realme Narzo N53 Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/1722066118566-revolutionizing-online-content-unveiling-eight-major-impacts-of-artificial-intelligence-chatbots/"><u>Revolutionizing Online Content: Unveiling Eight Major Impacts of Artificial Intelligence Chatbots.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/subtle-sound-reduction-tactics-with-garageband-for-2024/"><u>Subtle Sound Reduction Tactics with Garageband for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-hot.techidaily.com/top-rated-black-friday-deals-on-gift-cards-save-money-and-hassle-with-smart-shopping-tips-zdnet/"><u>Top-Rated Black Friday Deals on Gift Cards: Save Money and Hassle with Smart Shopping Tips | ZDNet</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If your HomeKit devices are reporting “No Response” in Apple’s Home app or Siri tells you the device is not responding, try some of the fixes below to solve the problem.</p><h2 id="1-Ensure-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-Are-On"><a href="#1-Ensure-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth-Are-On" class="headerlink" title="1  Ensure Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Are On"></a>1  Ensure Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Are On</h2><p> This sounds basic, but it’s always a good one to check first. Some HomeKit devices require both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to be enabled on your iPhone, so if you’ve disabled either the fix may be very simple! For example, my mobile phone bill arrives as a text link, but the link only works when using mobile data, so I need to switch off Wi-Fi to access it. If things are hectic, it can be easy to forget that I did this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-of-iphone-control-center-with-brightness-reduced-and-mobile-data-turned-off-and-wifi-enabled-1.png"                      alt="iPhone control center with Wi-Fi on and Bluetooth off."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134246/18498" target="_top" id="2134246">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134246" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134246/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you have more than one Wi-Fi network in your home, then things will fail if your iPhone is connected to a different network to your home hub. One way this can happen is if your main Wi-Fi network fails briefly, your iPhone may then connect to the wrong one, and not switch back when the main one is back.</p><p> Check under Settings &gt; Wi-Fi to see which network you’re connected to, or flick down and long press the Wi-Fi button (twice) in Control Center.</p><h2 id="2-Restart-Your-Home-Hub-and-Your-iPhone"><a href="#2-Restart-Your-Home-Hub-and-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="2  Restart Your Home Hub and Your iPhone"></a>2  Restart Your Home Hub and Your iPhone</h2><p> Perhaps the most common source of multiple HomeKit devices failing to respond is an issue with the home hub. This is the device that controls all your HomeKit devices, and—frustratingly—Apple doesn’t let us choose it.</p><p> HomePods and Apple TV units are automatically set as home hubs when they are connected, and you can also manually add an iPad as a hub provided that it always remains within the home. However, <em>which</em> of those devices is used as the home hub at any given time is something we can’t control, and will change from time to time on a seemingly random basis.</p><p> To check which device is your current active hub, open the Home app and tap the three-dot menu button top-right, then Home Settings &gt; Home Hubs &amp; Bridges. In the example below, you can see that Studio Office Left (a HomePod speaker) is my current home hub, so that’s the device I need to check.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/home-hub-shown-here-in-the-home-app.jpeg"                      alt="Home Hub shown here in the Home app"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2148127/17093" target="_top" id="2148127">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2148127" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2148127/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>(Screengrab)</p><p> The easiest way to reboot it is to simply unplug it from power, wait 10 seconds, then plug it in again. This will likely also result in the Home app picking a different device as the current hub.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-configuring-two-screens-with-your-mac/" >Restarting your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another quick and easy thing to try if rebooting the hub doesn’t work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/977686/11832" target="_top" id="977686">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-977686" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/977686/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Reboot-an-Unresponsive-Device"><a href="#3-Reboot-an-Unresponsive-Device" class="headerlink" title="3  Reboot an Unresponsive Device"></a>3  Reboot an Unresponsive Device</h2><p> If it’s instead a single HomeKit device that is failing to respond, then rebooting the device will often resolve it.</p><p> For a smart plug, simply unplug it, wait 10 seconds, then plug it in again. Bear in mind that it may then take another minute or two before it comes back online.</p><p> For bulbs, it depends on whether or not you have hardwired smart switches controlling them. Most people don’t, as smart switches are most commonly used to control dumb bulbs. In that case, just switch off the physical switch providing power to the circuit, wait 10 seconds, then switch it back on. Again, allow one to two minutes for it to finish rebooting. This step will also reveal whether someone has cut power by using the manual switch.</p><p> If a bulb is on a circuit controlled by a smart switch, then the issue could be with either the bulb or the switch. In this case, the best bet is to use the circuit breaker to cut power to the circuit for ten seconds. In this case, it may take a little longer for everything to come back online, so give it a few minutes.</p><h2 id="4-Reboot-Your-Router-and-Bridges"><a href="#4-Reboot-Your-Router-and-Bridges" class="headerlink" title="4  Reboot Your Router and Bridges"></a>4  Reboot Your Router and Bridges</h2><p> If the above steps don’t work, then the next thing to try is to reboot both your wireless router and the wireless bridges connected to it.</p><p> Start with the Wi-Fi router. By now, you know the drill: unplug it from mains power, wait 10 seconds, plug it in again and wait a few minutes for it to come back online. If this doesn’t work, then do the same with each of the wireless bridges.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tp_link_ax72.jpg"                      alt="TP Link AX72 router with four green lights."                > </p><p>Tim Brookes &#x2F; How-to Geek</p><p> In some cases, the unresponsive devices will give a solid clue as to the culprit. For example, if all your Philips Hue devices are unresponsive, but other things still work, then the Hue Bridge is the most likely suspect, so you can start by rebooting that.</p><h2 id="5-Choose-a-Different-Wi-Fi-Channel"><a href="#5-Choose-a-Different-Wi-Fi-Channel" class="headerlink" title="5  Choose a Different Wi-Fi Channel"></a>5  Choose a Different Wi-Fi Channel</h2><p> From this point on, things get a little more involved, so double-check that you have tried all of the above steps before going any further.</p><p> One common problem with wireless devices is congestion or conflicts on the Wi-Fi channel. If you frequently experience problems with either HomeKit devices or other Wi-Fi connections, then changing the channel may well be the answer.</p><p> The process for doing this will depend on your router, so check the instructions that came with it, or search the web for the steps for your router, but <a class="link"   href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/can-ai-enable-real-time-smart-home-adjustments/" >here is a common example <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> By default, your router may be set to choose the channel automatically. In the example below, we need to first change the top dropdown from “Auto” to “Manual” and can then choose the channel. <a class="link"   href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/three-ways-to-sim-unlock-oppo-a78-5g-by-drfone-android/" >You can find guidance here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on how to identify the best channel to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/changing-the-channel-on-a-wireless-router.jpg"                      alt="Changing the channel on a wireless router."                > </p><p> You can see above that the option is available for 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks, but note that almost all smart home devices operate on 2.4GHz, so this is the one we want to change.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815678/21290" target="_top" id="1815678">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815678" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815678/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Make-Sure-Everything-Is-Updated"><a href="#6-Make-Sure-Everything-Is-Updated" class="headerlink" title="6  Make Sure Everything Is Updated"></a>6  Make Sure Everything Is Updated</h2><p> Next up is to make sure that all devices are running the latest firmware. This means:</p><ul><li>Your wireless router</li><li>Your home hubs</li><li>Your bridges</li><li>Your smart home devices</li></ul><p> This is a tedious step, I know, but it’s surprising how often it will fix a persistent or recurring problem.</p><p> Again, consult the manufacturer’s instructions for details of how to do this. For Philips Hue devices, for example, you open the Hue app and tap Settings. Scroll down to the Advanced section and tap “Software Update.” This will show a list of all your devices. If an update is available for any one of them, a green dot will appear to the right of it, and there will be some text telling you that an update is available. In this case, it shows “New Version Available” for the bridge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/updating-a-philips-hue-device.jpeg"                      alt="Updating a Philips Hue device."                > </p><p> You can eliminate this step for many devices by selecting automatic updates. Again, for Hue devices, it’s Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Software Update and then flick on the “Automatic Updates” toggle. Note that the bridge will <em>not</em> be included in automatic updates, so you’ll need to do this manually when required.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/switching-on-automatic-updates-in-the-hue-app.jpeg"                      alt="Switching on automatic updates in the Hue app."                > </p><h2 id="7-Reposition-Your-Router-or-Home-Hub"><a href="#7-Reposition-Your-Router-or-Home-Hub" class="headerlink" title="7  Reposition Your Router or Home Hub"></a>7  Reposition Your Router or Home Hub</h2><p> In some cases, the issue may be that devices are not getting a good wireless connection to the router or home hub device. You can <a class="link"   href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-on-your-tecno-spark-10-pro-by-drfone-android/" >fix this by relocating your router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Moving a router after installation may not be a trivial exercise, but you’d be surprised how much difference can sometimes be made by a very small change in position. Similarly, with home hub devices: some HomeKit users have reported improvements with small changes like moving a HomePod by just a few inches, or even rotating the speaker to face a different direction! Wireless antennae can be sensitive things, and interference can often be just a matter of inches.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134237/18498" target="_top" id="2134237">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134237" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134237/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Remove-Devices-and-Add-Them-Again"><a href="#8-Remove-Devices-and-Add-Them-Again" class="headerlink" title="8  Remove Devices and Add Them Again"></a>8  Remove Devices and Add Them Again</h2><p> Yes, this one is also a pain, as resetting a device will lose all of its settings, which will also mean re-adding it to any scenes or automations. Again, make sure you’ve tried the above options first.</p><p> But if it is necessary, most HomeKit devices have a physical reset switch, often inside a tiny hole:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/the-recesssed-reset-switch-for-a-doorbell-camera.JPG"                      alt="The recesssed reset switch for a doorbell camera."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2052063/7443" target="_top" id="2052063">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2052063" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2052063/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ben Lovejoy &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> You’ll typically need to use a paperclip, or a SIM removal tool, to press this button. It will often be deeper into the device than you might expect and you should feel resistance when you press it. You’ll usually need to hold it in for a few seconds (a good rule of thumb is to count to 10 before releasing).</p><h2 id="9-The-Thermonuclear-Option"><a href="#9-The-Thermonuclear-Option" class="headerlink" title="9  The Thermonuclear Option"></a>9  The Thermonuclear Option</h2><p> The final step involves resetting your entire HomeKit home. This one you <em>definitely</em> don’t want to do unless your problems are persistent, and all else has failed. Make absolutely certain you’ve tried everything else on the list first, because if you do this, you’re going to lose all your settings, your scenes, your automations, your switch functions, everything.</p><p> You’re then going to have to manually add absolutely every device to your home, which in some cases is going to take hours. But if you really can’t avoid it, open the Home app, tap the three-dot menu button top-right, then tap “Home Settings”, scroll all the way to the bottom, and tap “Remove Home.”</p><p> You can then <a class="link"   href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/104998" >start again from scratch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><hr><p> One of the above is sure to fix the problem, but always start with the quick and easy things first, by working your way down the list in order.

While this choice of color might seem unpleasant and unimaginative by today’s standards, it offers a certain nostalgic vintage appeal that takes me back to the early days of the Windows desktop setup with those clunky PC units and monitors that were deeper than they were wide. Also used in earlier Windows NT versions in 1992 in pre-release builds, the teal color was pretty much the unofficial color of the 1990s. Not much is known about why this shade was chosen, but given that electric pink would have been a little more eye-searing, it seemed a wise choice and made its unforgettable mark on Windows history.</p><h2 id="Windows-98"><a href="#Windows-98" class="headerlink" title="Windows 98"></a>Windows 98</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/windows-98.jpg"                      alt="The Windows 98 desktop background"                > </p><p>wallpapers.com</p><p> In 1998, Windows launched the blue-sky theme that has been commonplace on our desktop background ever since, introducing white, fluffy clouds to distinguish it from its plainer predecessors. Windows 98 brought us many internet companion programs, such as Outlook Express, Microsoft Chat, and the Personal Web Server, so the blue sky is a nod to the freedom and endlessness offered by online browsing. Personally, I love the retro Windows icon and its representation of the developing technological world in which this desktop background was released.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068433/7443" target="_top" id="2068433">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068433" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068433/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Windows-2000"><a href="#Windows-2000" class="headerlink" title="Windows 2000"></a>Windows 2000</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/windows-2000.png"                      alt="The Windows 2000 desktop background"                > </p><p>WinClassic</p><p> If the Windows 98 desktop background didn’t scream <em>freedom</em>, the <a class="link"   href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-unbrick-a-dead-oneplus-12-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/" >Windows 2000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> one certainly did, with the silhouette of a person flying through an even clearer sky with their arms reaching out in front. While similar to the previous background, the inclusion of two overlapping squares in the top-left corner boldly serves as a marker of difference and change, as <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms997507%28v=msdn.10%29?redirectedfrom=MSDN" >Microsoft introduced translucent pop-up reminders and windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to allow multitasking and a less-intrusive experience.</p><h2 id="Windows-XP"><a href="#Windows-XP" class="headerlink" title="Windows XP"></a>Windows XP</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/windows-xp.jpg"                      alt="The Windows XP desktop background"                > </p><p>Wallpaper Hub</p><p> The Windows design we saw in XP marked the start of significant user-interface advancements that we’ve continued to see to this day. With the increased use of drop shadows, the first two-column Start menu layout, and the choice of blue, olive-green, and silver visual styles, <a class="link"   href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-live-stream-audio-effective-recording-methods-for-the-digital-age/" >Windows XP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> really was an overhauled desktop experience. The “Bliss” desktop background was another part of this dramatic upgrade, as Microsoft moved from its graphically produced designs to an unedited photograph of Sonoma County’s green hills.</p><p> Previously known as “Bucolic Green Hills,” photographer Charles O’Rear snapped this idyllic picture when traveling to visit his girlfriend. Driving past the scene, he noticed that the field was greener than usual, a characteristic widely attributed to the heavy rainstorm that had just emptied itself onto the apparently never-ending hills. The fact that this field was previously a vineyard but was wiped out due to a phylloxera infection probably added to its strikingly green appearance. Despite being an incidental addition to the Windows desktop gallery, you can still notice the well-known blue-sky-white-cloud backdrop that had formed the basis of the previous designs, so it’s no wonder the hierarchy at Microsoft decided it was the ideal next stop on its visual journey.</p><h2 id="Windows-Vista"><a href="#Windows-Vista" class="headerlink" title="Windows Vista"></a>Windows Vista</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/windows-vista-1.jpg"                      alt="The Windows Vista desktop background."                > </p><p>Microsoft</p><p> Seen by many Windows customers as the most beautiful background to date, <a class="link"   href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-boosting-likes-with-tiktoks-trending-hashtags/" >Windows Vista’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “Aurora” is an attention-grabbing design. Given that Microsoft’s headquarters is based in Redmond, Washington, where the Northern Lights are often viewable, it’s no surprise that this astronomy-themed desktop background was given the go-ahead by the tech giant’s developers. The depiction of moving, wavy lines represents calmness and tranquility. More striking, however, is the clarity of inspiration drawn from the XP “Bliss” background, with the divide between the yellow and the green forming the same shape as the tops of the rolling hills in O’Rear’s photograph. This natural progression certainly hasn’t gone unnoticed, alongside the aura of tranquility offered by the wavy lines and unintimidating colors.</p><h2 id="Windows-7"><a href="#Windows-7" class="headerlink" title="Windows 7"></a>Windows 7</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/windows-7.jpg"                      alt="The Windows 7 desktop background."                > </p><p>Microsoft</p><p> While the XP design eight years prior was a more explicit representation of the outdoors, the tree and butterfly watermarked into the Windows logo in the Windows 7 background design is a more subtle nod towards the world’s increasing interest in nature.

However, the focused flower on the left and the unfocused flower on the right coincide with the launch of the Windows Photos app in the same year, and the repeated emphasis towards nature continues the theme in the previous desktop background. Interestingly, though, this was the last time we saw the blue sky and white clouds that had filled our screens on and off for the past 12 years.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100526/7443" target="_top" id="2100526">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100526" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Windows-10"><a href="#Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Windows 10"></a>Windows 10</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/windows-10.png"                      alt="The Windows 10 desktop background."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135349/19272" target="_top" id="2135349">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135349" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135349/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>GMUNK</p><p> “Hero,” designed by GMUNK, saw the return of a live photograph as the desktop background image—albeit heavily layered. The designers began by cutting four squares into black cardboard before cutting the same design into some acrylic and matching them together. Then, light was directed through the design from an off-angle to capture the glints of the acrylic, resulting in the glistening effect we see in the image. In total, over 3,000 pictures were taken and combined at 9k resolution. <a class="link"   href="https://gmunk.com/Windows-10-Desktop" >According to GMUNK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the aim was “not to just tell the story of Windows, but to tell the story of everything behind and traveling through it, of the advances and techniques that keep the brand moving forward into the future”—and that’s clear to see in this striking design.</p><h2 id="Windows-11"><a href="#Windows-11" class="headerlink" title="Windows 11"></a>Windows 11</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/windows-11.jpg"                      alt="The Windows 11 desktop background"                > </p><p>Microsoft</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-lock-screen-settings-on-your-realme-12-5g-by-drfone-android/" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> brought a more centrally-aligned theme to its customers, with the taskbar more closely mirroring the MacOS design.

So, even though we aren’t certain what the new desktop background image will be, we can quite confidently say that there will be lots of changes to the interface, meaning we could also expect significant changes to the wallpaper design.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-efficient-techniques-for-distributing-youtube-videos-via-facebook/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Efficient Techniques for Distributing YouTube Videos via Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-ms-edges-picture-in-picture-magic/"><u>[New] Unveiling MS Edge's Picture-in-Picture Magic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-infuse-your-instagram-with-funny-flair-a-complete-guide-to-gif-memes/"><u>[Updated] Infuse Your Instagram with Funny Flair – A Complete Guide to GIF Memes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-luster-leads-transformative-techniques-for-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Luster Leads Transformative Techniques for Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/fast-track-driver-downloads-for-your-dell-g7-a-hassle-free-approach/"><u>Fast-Track Driver Downloads for Your Dell G7: A Hassle-Free Approach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/gta-not-working-heres-how-to-get-your-online-adventure-back-on-track/"><u>GTA nOt wOrkIng?

If this happens, switch to desktop for the full experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/editing-a-profile-on-discord.png"                      alt="Editing a profile on Discord."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1175223/12108" target="_top" id="1175223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1175223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1175223/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> I think it’s great that <a class="link"   href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-do-i-stop-someone-from-tracking-my-samsung-galaxy-a14-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >Discord offers so much personalization <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, especially on the profile. It’s a nice way to express yourself, and I like checking out other people’s profiles to see what they look like.</p><p> Some of these customizations, like the banner image or using an animated GIF as your avatar, are only available if you <a class="link"   href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/forgot-apple-iphone-12-mini-backup-password-heres-what-to-do-by-drfone-ios/" >pay for Discord Nitro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Discord sells lots of avatar decorations and profile effects based on charming themes like anime, pirates, and cyberpunk.</p><p> These start at a minimum of $5.99, going up to an eye-watering $12.99 for something from the SpongeBob SquarePants range. If you’re a Discord Nitro member, you get a measly few dollars discount.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/spongebob-squarepants-items-on-the-discord-shop-2.png"                      alt="SpongeBob SquarePants items on the Discord shop."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134236/18498" target="_top" id="2134236">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134236" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134236/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> These purchases are one-time and permanent, meaning you can use them forever even if they’re seasonal and removed from the shop. But despite that, the pricing seems extortionate, especially if you’re someone who likes to redesign their profile often.</p><p> It also seems cheeky that Nitro members don’t get more items for free, or at least a deeper discount in the shop, especially since Nitro costs a not-insignificant $9.99&#x2F;month (for the tier that includes custom profiles).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902319/19272" target="_top" id="1902319">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902319" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902319/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-the-Cost-of-Discord’s-Cosmetics-a-Problem"><a href="#Is-the-Cost-of-Discord’s-Cosmetics-a-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Is the Cost of Discord’s Cosmetics a Problem?"></a>Is the Cost of Discord’s Cosmetics a Problem?</h2><p> Paying for profile cosmetics isn’t anything new. Steam sells similar goodies, payable in points which are mostly earned by buying games. This is more tolerable because Steam is primarily a game storefront, so you get points through natural use of the platform. You can also buy in local currency from others on the community marketplace.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/steam-points-shop.png"                      alt="Steam points shop."                > </p><p> Steam has many other avenues of revenue, so the comparison to Discord isn’t equal. But when Discord already sells a monthly membership, and then sets the price of extra items so high, it makes it feel like a cash grab as opposed to a fun feature.</p><p> All that said, the cosmetics are entirely optional—the core Discord experience isn’t impacted. Discord itself is free to use, so you can happily chat to your friends without this bothering you, and if enough people are willing to buy these items to keep it that way, that’s great.</p><hr><p> I’ll keep using Discord for all its awesome features, like being able to <a class="link"   href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-for-students-discover-the-top-10-historical-youtube-channels-now/" >watch movies with friends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. However, as much as I’d like to deck out my profile, I can’t justify the cost.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/n-2024-command-center-redefined-your-pathway-through-studio/"><u>[New] In 2024, Command Center Redefined Your Pathway Through Studio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-unleashing-the-full-power-of-apple-podcasts-downloads/"><u>[Updated] Unleashing the Full Power of Apple Podcasts Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-to-mastering-kinemaster-plus-10-best-video-editors-online/"><u>2024 Approved Step-by-Step Guide to Mastering KineMaster + 10 Best Video Editors Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-backchannel-bridge-engaging-with-your-audience/"><u>2024 Approved The Backchannel Bridge Engaging with Your Audience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unique-content-creation-the-ultimate-guide-to-6-video-types/"><u>2024 Approved Unique Content Creation The Ultimate Guide to 6 Video Types</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/decoding-the-excellence-of-samsungs-qn55q6f-an-in-depth-review-of-a-top-tier-4k-hdr-smart-television/"><u>Decoding the Excellence of Samsung's QN55Q6F: An In-Depth Review of a Top-Tier 4K HDR Smart Television</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-to-get-and-use-pokemon-go-promo-codes-on-honor-100-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Get and Use Pokemon Go Promo Codes On Honor 100 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-fine-tuning-release-timings-for-podcasts/"><u>In 2024, Fine-Tuning Release Timings for Podcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-location-on-tiktok-to-see-more-content-on-your-nubia-red-magic-9-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Location on TikTok to See More Content On your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-off-facebook-insights-what-they-reveal-and-when-to-turn-them-off/"><u>In 2024, Off-Facebook Insights What They Reveal & When to Turn Them Off</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-future-of-virtual-showrooms/"><u>In 2024, The Future of Virtual Showrooms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-therapeutic-effects-of-asmr-for-everyone/"><u>In 2024, The Therapeutic Effects of ASMR for Everyone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-set-of-free-photo-screen-shifts/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate Set of Free Photo Screen Shifts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-guide-for-non-functional-steelseries-arctis-prime-mic/"><u>Troubleshooting Guide for Non-Functional SteelSeries Arctis Prime Mic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/unraveling-the-new-dimensions-of-vegaspro-19-for-2024/"><u>Unraveling the New Dimensions of VegasPro '19 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/web-wanderers-guide-tracking-pages-profiles-in-fb/"><u>Web Wanderer's Guide: Tracking Pages, Profiles in FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/why-does-the-pokemon-go-battle-league-not-available-on-lava-yuva-2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Why does the pokemon go battle league not available On Lava Yuva 2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Exploring-the-Remarkable-Ease-of-Repairing-the-HMD-Skyline-Among-Modern-Mobile-Devices"><a href="#Exploring-the-Remarkable-Ease-of-Repairing-the-HMD-Skyline-Among-Modern-Mobile-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Exploring the Remarkable Ease of Repairing the HMD Skyline Among Modern Mobile Devices"></a>Exploring the Remarkable Ease of Repairing the HMD Skyline Among Modern Mobile Devices</h2><p>HMD Global has been making phones and tablets with the Nokia name for years, but now it’s trying to sell phones with its own brand. <a class="link"   href="https://sovrn.co/dcq0mfx" >The HMD Skyline <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the company’s latest device, and it’s one of the most repairable smartphones you can get.</p><p> HMD announced its fourth repairable HMD smartphone today, following the release of the Pulse, Pulse+, and Pulse Pro. Those earlier models required a prying tool to take off the back cover, which can easily cause damage to the casing if you’re not careful. The Skyline has a new Torx screw that releases the back cover, allowing you to easily pull off the rest of the case with a prying tool (or the edge of a plastic card).</p><p> The screen is held inside the phone using a foam gasket, instead of the glue used by most other smartphones. The battery still uses glue for positioning, but HMD said in a blog post, “we’ve carefully considered the strength of the adhesive so that a gentle pull is enough to get it free.” The HMD Skyline earned a repairability score of 9&#x2F;10 from iFixit, coming close to <a class="link"   href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/87664/fairphone-5-keeping-it-10-10" >the 10&#x2F;10 score from the Fairphone 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and far better than most mass-market smartphones.</p><p> The rest of the hardware and specifications are typical for an upper-midrange Android smartphone. It has a Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset, a 6.5-inch 144Hz OLED screen, 128 or 256 GB internal storage, 8 or 12 GB RAM, a 4,600mAh battery, 33W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.2 with LE audio. There are three rear cameras: a 108 MP main lens, a 13MP ultra-wide camera, and a 50MP telephoto lens. The front-facing camera is 50MP.</p><p> The IP54 rating for water and dust resistance is lower than the IP68 rating for many other modern phones, but that might be the result of the more repairable design, at least in part. It’s easier to keep water out of a phone that’s totally glued together.</p><p> HMD Global is promising two major Android OS updates and three years of security fixes, and the phone ships with Android 14. That’s not great, especially with some budget phones delivering <a class="link"   href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/vn-video-editor-on-mac-download-install-or-explore-alternatives-for-2024/" >five years of security updates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or more. Repairability is important for keeping a device functional over time, but so is software support.</p><p> You’ll be able to <a class="link"   href="https://sovrn.co/dcq0mfx" >buy the HMD Skyline <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> starting in August for $499, in either “Twisted Black” or “Neon Pink.”</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/97701/hmd-skyline-a-new-twist-on-repairable-smartphone-design" >iFixit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.hmd.com/en%5Fint/blog/what-ifixit-repairability-team-says-about-hmd-skyline" >HMD Global <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-balancing-main-footage-with-b-roll-to-avoid-overkill-for-2024/"><u>[New] Balancing Main Footage with B-Roll to Avoid Overkill for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-the-best-10-final-cut-pro-plugins-ever/"><u>[New] The Best 10 Final Cut Pro Plugins Ever</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-top-10-premier-livestream-services-unveiled/"><u>[New] Top 10 Premier Livestream Services Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-traversing-through-windows-movie-makers-version-landscape/"><u>[New] Traversing Through Windows Movie Maker's Version Landscape</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-best-monitors-for-xbox-series-x/"><u>2024 Approved The Best Monitors for Xbox Series X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-icloud-unlock-from-apple-iphone-7-online-by-drfone-ios/"><u>A Comprehensive Guide to iCloud Unlock From Apple iPhone 7 Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/excellent-service-245-happy-customers/"><u>Excellent Service - 245% Happy Customers!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-pokemon-go-no-gps-signal-heres-every-possible-solution-on-realme-c67-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Pokemon Go No GPS Signal?

Through it, the company has continued its dominance in the camera market for the last 3 months thanks to the dual-lens camera setup. The camera setup, the design, and the hardware improvements is surely seeing Huawei P10 outstand its rivals in the market.

As a matter of fact, in this section we will elaborate on the features of the P10. After all, we would love to give you a deeper understanding of Huawei P10 4K Smartphone-the design, the performance as well as the software and the UI details.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027190/19272" target="_top" id="2027190">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027190" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027190/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Huawei-P10-Design-Quality"><a href="#Huawei-P10-Design-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Huawei P10 Design Quality"></a>Huawei P10 Design Quality</h3><p>In this section, we will review the body design, the display, the hardware and the network connectivity of the P10. Let’s start with the body design:</p><h4 id="1-Huawei-P10-Body-Design"><a href="#1-Huawei-P10-Body-Design" class="headerlink" title="1.Huawei P10 Body Design"></a>1.Huawei P10 Body Design</h4><p>The body design of Huawei P10 looks more like an iPhone than other Huawei phones. The phone has a solid make with a whole body metallic structure. The use of the Gorilla Glass 5 on the front screen gives the phone a reasonable scratch resistance in the event that the phone falls or kept in a bag that has piercing items.</p><p>The round corners make it the most comfortable phone to use. The power button has been slightly indented to ensure that the volume lovers do not confuse the two buttons when operating the phone.</p><p>Across the bottom edge of the phone, there is a single speaker port, a USB port and a 3.5mm headphone jack well designed for those guys who love using phones for music.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/huawei-p10-body-design.jpg"                      alt="huawei-p10-body-design"                ></p><p>The phone’s 7mm thickness and the weight of 142g make it more portable and easy to hold even for the users with the small hands. The MicroSD card slot at the edge gives room for the users to have an expandable memory when need be to complement the 64GB internal memory.</p><p>The fingerprint scanner has been placed at the front position, which makes it both appealing and easy-to-use. This is a rare positioning for most of the phones with a fingerprint technology using the index finger perfectly matches the fingerprint position, such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Samsung Galaxy S8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The fingerprint scanner also has additional functions.</p><p>Huawei P10 comes with a variety of colors giving the users a variety to choose from. Some of the available colors may include the graphite black, dazzling blue, dazzling gold, rose gold, prestige gold, white ceramic, mystic silver and the greenery. The model also has a new finishing with the hyper-diamond cut available on the dazzling blue and gold options. Moreover, it has the acceptable sandblasted finish which makes it classy because of the tiny ridges along the length of the phone.</p><h4 id="2-Huawei-P10-Display"><a href="#2-Huawei-P10-Display" class="headerlink" title="2.Huawei P10 Display"></a>2.Huawei P10 Display</h4><p>Huawei P10 comes with the 5.1-inch and the 1080p resolution display. This is by far the most realistic kind of display you can get from any kind of the flagship. The P10 has 432ppi making it virtually impossible to identify the individual pixels and icons as the images are super sharp. If you are looking for a higher resolution with bigger screen size, you can buy Huawei P10 Plus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/huawei-p10-screen.jpg"                      alt="huawei-p10-screen"                ></p><p>The Huawei P10 has the IPS-NEO panel which allows for more blacks than it is the case when regular IPS screens are used. The model also comes with the improved viewing angles. The whites are also appealing as they are clean and the colors are not overdone. The brightness levels of the phone are also high to a point that you can comfortably use the phone when the brightness is between 30-40%.</p><p>It is also very easy for the users to access all the corners of the display without having to stretch the fingers. This makes it very easy for the users to use both hands when interacting with the phone’s UI.</p><h4 id="3-Huawei-P10-Hardware"><a href="#3-Huawei-P10-Hardware" class="headerlink" title="3.Huawei P10 Hardware"></a>3.Huawei P10 Hardware</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/huawei-p10-ports.jpg"                      alt="huawei-p10-ports"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036467/19272" target="_top" id="2036467">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036467" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036467/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The hardware aspect is perhaps one of the main reason why you shouldn’t miss out on Huawei P10. The device is a carrier of the Proprietary Kirin 960 Octo-core processor which comes with four, Cortex 1.8 GHz; A53’s aligned next to the 2.4 GHz A73’s. The smaller cores are responsible for every day’s tasks such as making and receiving calls, sending and receiving messages and other important background processes. The faster cores are mainly put into use when completing intensive functions using the phone. The intensive functions include the shooting of the 4K videos, the playing of the mobile phone games as well as taking photos.</p><p>The phone has an impressive speed and has the HDR whose main use is to ease the speed of the phone whenever its battery is underpowered. The speed also makes it possible for the users to navigate between different shooting and video modes.</p><p>Huawei P10 comes with the internal storage space of 64GB (standard version) and allows room for the additional 256 GB SD card. This memory allocation may exert little pressure on the 3200mAh battery so that it is possible to use it as long as 15 hours of the normal functions and the 5hours 15 minutes of the live video streaming with the phone on its full brightness mode.</p><p>The fast charging options are also available for the Huawei P10 phone. In other words, it will take the users 1 hour and 40 minutes to have the drained battery full charged when using the SuperCharge mains adapter. However, using the USB ports, it may take longer than 4 hours. It is however possible to switch the phone into the power saving mode to prolong the battery usage.</p><h4 id="4-Huawei-P10-Network-connectivity"><a href="#4-Huawei-P10-Network-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="4.Huawei P10 Network connectivity"></a>4.Huawei P10 Network connectivity</h4><p>This is yet another important consideration that any phone user ought to know. Huawei P10 has a pack of 12 LTE radio antenna. The antennas will ensure virtually the fastest download and upload speed you can get on a mobile phone carrier-of course depending on the country you are living in.</p><h3 id="Huawei-P10-Software-and-UI"><a href="#Huawei-P10-Software-and-UI" class="headerlink" title="Huawei P10 Software and UI"></a>Huawei P10 Software and UI</h3><p>The Huawei P10 comes with the Android 7.0 version blended with the Huawei’s Emotion UI 5.1. Huawei Emotion UI 5.1 is responsible for boosting user action prediction through machine learning. In fact, the phone can predict some of your actions using machine learning algorithms hence improving the way you interact with the phone. The real beauty is that Huawei has improved the OS with the use of ultra memory which allows the phone to run smoothly given that it recycles the memory faster and handles threading super efficiently. The phone might not have the Google daydream support but has provisions for the audio selfies.</p><h3 id="Huawei-P10-Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Huawei-P10-Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Huawei P10 Features and Performance"></a>Huawei P10 Features and Performance</h3><p>You may get an idea about the P10 review from the above video, now let’s check it in details about its performance.</p><h4 id="1-Huawei-P10-Camera-performance"><a href="#1-Huawei-P10-Camera-performance" class="headerlink" title="1.Huawei P10 Camera performance"></a>1.Huawei P10 Camera performance</h4><p>Huawei has a dual-lens 12+20 megapixels camera, which is co-designed with Leica, allowing for the excellent and sharp stills. When the HDR has been switched on, you are likely to get very impressive photos. This is so especially when taking the pictures in early mornings or evening. The wide range of contrasts makes it possible to take sharp photos without the shadow being displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/huawei-p10-rear-camera.jpg"                      alt="huawei-p10-rear-camera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129043/19576" target="_top" id="2129043">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129043" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129043/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The dual camera setup also allows for the processing of light and contrast information. This helps the users to realize better and less noisy shots.</p><p>The camera also has the different modes which help you to refocus the shots after you have taken them. With this, you can have a different mode for the same shot. It is also possible to capture the foreground and the background information.</p><p>The camera also allows for the autofocus where you just need to focus and the shots rearrange themselves. It is also possible for the users to have the shots saved in different document formats. This can be sent to the printers directly especially with the WI-FI turned on.</p><p>The ultra shot mode also makes it possible to take photos when the screen is off by simply pressing the volume button down.</p><p>The device also comes with a number of video modes which includes the 4K Ultra HD at 30fps and the 1080p Full HD which comes at 60fps.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Video Editing Apps for Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Huawei-P10-Battery-performance"><a href="#2-Huawei-P10-Battery-performance" class="headerlink" title="2.Huawei P10 Battery performance"></a>2.Huawei P10 Battery performance</h4><p>The battery life is another instance in which Huawei P10 has worked to meet the escalating demands of today’s phone user. This is because the phone features a 3200mAh which is certainly one of the best one can get for an Android phone. With the average user or in the absence of the intensive applications, the battery can serve the users for a whole day and leave it charging when they go to sleep. As stated earlier, the Huawei P10 comes with the quick charging technology which makes it possible to move the battery from dead to 30% in less than 10 minutes. The quick charging technology, however, has been built on the charger and not the phone.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Having looked at all the aspects of P10, we can now certainly conclude that it is an awesome phone mainly because of its outstanding processor performance, the powerful camera, the durable and quick charging battery complete with sleek full metallic body. It is clear that the positives of the model far outweigh the few benefits and hence I can recommend the P10 to any potential buyer who wants to experience all the above advantages. Most of the downsides are user based and hence you can have the P10 and avoid the listed cons depending on how you use it. If you do not have a challenge paying for the high price of the P10, then get this model to start taking the crisp stills and video, play games and stream media throughout the day without worrying about the battery.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139117/17108" target="_top" id="2139117">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139117" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139117/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-the-smart-way-to-scale-and-slash-iphone-videos/"><u>[New] The Smart Way to Scale & Slash iPhone Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-free-open-sources-20-best-pubg-shots/"><u>[New] Ultimate Free, Open Sources 20 Best PUBG Shots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-understanding-key-differences-in-panoramic-and-vr-cinematography/"><u>[New] Understanding Key Differences in Panoramic and VR Cinematography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-unleashing-vibrance-grading-secrets-in-ps/"><u>[New] Unleashing Vibrance Grading Secrets in PS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-idea-to-action-founding-your-consumer-product-assessment-site/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From Idea to Action Founding Your Consumer Product Assessment Site</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-master-subtitles-from-srt-with-3-steps/"><u>[Updated] Master Subtitles From SRT with 3 Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-topline-numbers-pewdiepies-yearly-income/"><u>[Updated] Topline Numbers PewDiePie's Yearly Income</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-unleashing-creativity-with-iphone-shadow-photography/"><u>[Updated] Unleashing Creativity with iPhone Shadow Photography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-8-innovative-affordable-online-srt-services-exposed/"><u>2024 Approved Top 8 Innovative, Affordable Online SRT Services Exposed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/can-life360-track-or-see-text-messages-what-can-you-do-with-life360-on-realme-c67-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Can Life360 Track Or See Text Messages?

Here are three in-game performance monitoring apps I wholeheartedly recommend to every PC gamer, regardless of which hardware you’re using.</p><h2 id="NVIDIA-Statistics-Overlay"><a href="#NVIDIA-Statistics-Overlay" class="headerlink" title="NVIDIA Statistics Overlay"></a>NVIDIA Statistics Overlay</h2><p> The NVIDIA Statistics Overlay is part of <a class="link"   href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-13-pro-with-an-apple-watch-and-what-to-do-if-it-doesnt-work-drfone-by-drfone-ios/" >GeForce Experience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the new <a class="link"   href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-allshare-cast-to-turn-on-screen-mirroring-on-lava-blaze-curve-5g-drfone-by-drfone-android/" >NVIDIA app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning you probably already have access to it if you own an NVIDIA graphics card. I like this one because it’s fairly simple to set up and use. While it lacks some important performance monitoring stats, such as a frame-time graph, it’s a solid choice for PC gamers who just want the basics. Perhaps the biggest disadvantage of this tool is that, naturally, it isn’t available to owners of AMD GPUs.</p><p> The NVIDIA Statistics Overlay includes an impressive suite of latency-related performance stats that include render latency (the time needed for your graphics card to fully render a single frame), mouse latency, combined PC and display latency (the time from when your OS registers your mouse click to when a frame is rendered of your monitor), and total system latency.</p><p> Setting up the overlay is pretty straightforward. Note that the following guide is for the <a class="link"   href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-eu/software/nvidia-app/" >NVIDIA app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but the procedure is quite similar if you’ve got <a class="link"   href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-eu/geforce/geforce-experience/" >GeForce Experience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> installed on your PC instead.</p><p> You can pull up the overlay when in-game by pressing Alt+R while GeForce Experience or the NVIDIA app runs in the background. To set up and tweak the overlay, press Alt+Z to open the NVIDIA overlay and then select the “Statistics” tab located at the bottom of the NVIDIA in-game overlay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-in-game-performance-monitoring-tools-i-recommend-to-every-pc-gamer-01.png"                      alt="NVIDIA Overlay main menu."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068408/7443" target="_top" id="2068408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068408/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Once there, make sure to select the “Custom” statistics view, click on the “View All” button, and then simply enable the performance metrics you want to see on the statistics overlay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-in-game-performance-monitoring-tools-i-recommend-to-every-pc-gamer-03.png"                      alt="NVIDIA overlay in-game statistics options menu."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137412/7443" target="_top" id="2137412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> You can also configure the heads-up display by clicking the “Configure Heads Up Display” button in the “Statistics” options menu.</p><h2 id="RivaTuner-Statistics-Server"><a href="#RivaTuner-Statistics-Server" class="headerlink" title=" RivaTuner Statistics Server"></a><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-in-game-performance-monitoring-tools-i-recommend-to-every-pc-gamer-02.png"                      alt="NVIDIA Overlay Statistics options menu"                > RivaTuner Statistics Server</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135366/19272" target="_top" id="2135366">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135366" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135366/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The legendary <a class="link"   href="https://www.guru3d.com/page/rivatuner-rtss-homepage/" >RivaTuner Statistics Server <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, also known as RTSS, is the oldest in-game performance monitoring tool on this list. I’ve been using RTSS for more than a decade, and in that time, I’ve had zero issues with it.</p><p> I like it because it has an impressive suite of performance metrics you can monitor and because it’s fairly simple to use after you learn how to configure it. On the other hand, RTSS requires a third-party app to pull the performance data from. Since RTSS is bundled with <a class="link"   href="https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards" >MSI Afterburner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, I recommend using that combo because MSI Afterburner can provide most of the GPU and CPU-related stats you’d want to monitor.</p><p> But if you want to also monitor advanced CPU stats such as per-core clocks, RAM sticks, and SSD thermals or include other exotic stats such as your motherboard chipset thermals, voltage of different PSU rails, and much more, you’ll need to install and configure <a class="link"   href="https://www.hwinfo.com/download/" >HWiNFO64 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> I recommend downloading and installing the <a class="link"   href="http://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards" >MSI Afterburner and RTSS combo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Download and configure HWiNFO only if you want access to advanced stats not found in MSI Afterburner.</p><p> After you download and install both apps, open RTSS, which you can find in the taskbar notification area. You might have to click the “Show Hidden Icons” button to access the RTSS and MSI Afterburner icons. Once you open RTSS, set the “On Screen Display Support” to ON.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-in-game-performance-monitoring-tools-i-recommend-to-every-pc-gamer-004.png"                      alt="RivaTuner Statistics Server main window."                > </p><p> Don’t forget that you can add game EXE files to RTSS and create custom RTSS profiles. For example, if a game uses anti-cheat that can block RTSS, I recommend creating a custom profile and disabling the on-screen display (OSD) only in that game. You can also tweak a couple more OSD-related options in RTSS, such as the OSD zoom level.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-in-game-performance-monitoring-tools-i-recommend-to-every-pc-gamer-04.png"                      alt="RTSS Main Window."                > </p><p> You can also use RTSS as an in-game frame limiter, which I recommend because I’ve found it works much better than frame limiters available in games or those available in NVIDIA and AMD apps.</p><p> Once you finish setting up RTSS-related options, open MSI Afterburner, locate the settings icon, and click it. Once you’re in the options menu, locate the “On-Screen Display” tab and assign the keys to show and hide the on-screen display, as shown below. You can also assign a key to toggle the OSD, but in my case, the OSD toggle doesn’t work no matter which key I assign.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-in-game-performance-monitoring-tools-i-recommend-to-every-pc-gamer-05.png"                      alt="MSI Afterburner Main window and the On-Screen Display options menu."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130870/7443" target="_top" id="2130870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Now, click the “Monitoring” tab. In this tab, you can pick any in-game performance metric you want to see on the OSD; to enable it, click the “Show in On-Screen Display” box. You can also rename every metric by clicking the “Override Graph Name” and “Override Group Name” buttons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-in-game-performance-monitoring-tools-i-recommend-to-every-pc-gamer-06-2.png"                      alt="MSI Afterburner main window and the Monitoring menu."                > </p><p> After you enable the performance stats you want to see on the OSD, click the “Apply” button, and try out the OSD by entering the game and pressing the button you’ve mapped to open the RTSS performance overlay.</p><h2 id="Intel-PresentMon"><a href="#Intel-PresentMon" class="headerlink" title="Intel PresentMon"></a>Intel PresentMon</h2><p> The third and last entry on this list is <a class="link"   href="https://game.intel.com/us/intel-presentmon/" >Intel PresentMon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. I’ve been using PresentMon for a few months and can say that it works great and offers enough performance monitoring metrics for most PC gamers, including advanced users. Compared to RTSS, PresentMon may be a better solution because it doesn’t require third-party software to pull performance metrics from.</p><p> While RTSS is still my favorite, I recommend PresentMon to all PC gamers looking for an all-in-one solution that doesn’t require additional software, as well as to NVIDIA GPU owners who find the NVIDIA statistics overlay lacking.</p><p> While PresentMon trumps both NVIDIA statistics overlay and RTSS in multiple aspects, its main advantage over the other two in-game performance monitoring tools featured on this list is the fact it supports GPU and CPU busy metrics, which are quite handy when trying to identify your system’s <a class="link"   href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-windows-11-what-to-do-if-your-system-fails-to-shut-down/" >main bottleneck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> In a nutshell, these stats show you the percentage of time when your GPU or CPU is busy. For GPU-bound workloads, such as video games, you want your GPU to be busy 100% of the time since that means your GPU doesn’t sit idle waiting on data from your CPU. Watch the in-depth explanation video below by Gamers Nexus for more on GPU and CPU busy metrics.</p><p> Setting up Intel PresentMon is fairly straightforward. First, <a class="link"   href="http://game.intel.com/us/intel-presentmon/" >download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install the software.</p><p> Next, open the app. From there, you can either pick one of the monitoring presets or create a custom one. You can also customize general settings, such as the position and size of the overlay, by clicking the “Settings” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-in-game-performance-monitoring-tools-i-recommend-to-every-pc-gamer-007.png"                      alt="Intel PresentMon main window."                > </p><p> When you select the custom preset, click the “Edit” button to customize it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-in-game-performance-monitoring-tools-i-recommend-to-every-pc-gamer-07.png"                      alt="Intel PresentMon main Window."                > </p><p> Once in the configuration menu, explore different options and create your perfect monitoring overlay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-in-game-performance-monitoring-tools-i-recommend-to-every-pc-gamer-08.png"                      alt="Intel PresentMon custom preset configuration menu."                > </p><p> You can combine multiple metrics by pressing the “Plus” button. For example, you can combine GPU and CPU busy graphs with GPU and CPU wait graphs, average and 99% low FPS, CPU and GPU utilization, and more. The “Options” button next to the “Plus” button allows you to customize each graph.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-in-game-performance-monitoring-tools-i-recommend-to-every-pc-gamer-09.png"                      alt="Intel PresentMon custom preset configuration menu."                > </p><p> Don’t forget that you can show most data as readouts—numbers, in other words—or graphs.</p><hr><p> I hope this guide has helped you find your next in-game performance monitoring tool.

Lots of it is 100% free, and some of it is absolutely top-tier. However, because it’s made for developers, it’s not exactly user-friendly. Here’s how to find your way around.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948949/19272" target="_top" id="1948949">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948949" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948949/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Find-Reputable-Free-Software"><a href="#How-to-Find-Reputable-Free-Software" class="headerlink" title="How to Find (Reputable!) Free Software"></a>How to Find (Reputable!) Free Software</h2><p> Searching for “free” apps on the internet can be perilous. Malware creators are just itching for you to click on a search result that leads to their malicious site (and they’re pretty good at making them look attractive), and then tricking you into downloading a virus or trojan.</p><p> So, before you go and start downloading things from the internet, make sure you’re <a class="link"   href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-pinnacle-of-video-quality-3-key-transcoder-strategies/" >protected with a reputable antivirus solution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (ideally one with web browser integration that flags suspicious downloads <em>before</em> they reach your device).</p><p> Now you’re ready to start searching.</p><p> Free, <a class="link"   href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-masterful-bio-upgrade-merging-linktree-with-tiktoks-profiles/" >open source <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software for productivity (word processing, drawing, video editing, and design), gaming, and even entire operating systems can be found on GitHub, but it can be difficult to wade through the vast number of projects (stored in “repositories”), especially as many of them are developer tools that don’t make much sense for regular users.</p><p> That’s why it’s much easier to use websites dedicated to curating lists of free software, than trying to browse GitHub directly. If you’re on Windows, <a class="link"   href="https://ninite.com/"  title="https://ninite.com/">Ninite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides an installer for a collection of high-quality free apps that cover a lot of common PC tasks (so your search for free stuff may end there if you’re after something specific).</p><p> If you know the category of the app you want, or know the name of a paid product, you can also punch it into <a class="link"   href="https://alternativeto.net/"  title="https://alternativeto.net/">AlternativeTo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get a list of similar software, and filter it to the free options. Every app on Alternative to has is ranked and reviewed, so you can stick to the ones that are in good standing with other users. Despite sites like AlternativeTo making it easy to find free software with a friendly interface, inevitably you’ll run into a free app that is hosted on <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/"  title="https://github.com/">GitHub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and need to navigate its confusing interface.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135371/19272" target="_top" id="2135371">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135371" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135371/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Download-Ready-To-Use-Apps-on-GitHub"><a href="#How-To-Download-Ready-To-Use-Apps-on-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="How To Download Ready-To-Use Apps on GitHub"></a>How To Download Ready-To-Use Apps on GitHub</h2><p> Once you’ve landed on the GitHub page for a free app or game, the next step is to determine whether a pre-packaged version is available. Software is published to GitHub as source code, and it cannot be run directly on your computer without taking a number of technical steps to build it, something regular users don’t have the tools to accomplish. Some developers, however, do provide packaged code, either on GitHub, or on their own websites. You just have to find it!</p><p> To start your hunt for the fabled download link, scroll down the page for the GitHub project, and look for the <strong>README</strong> section (past the list of files and developer jargon). This is where the developer puts all the information users need to get started. Often, there’s an obvious download link included here, so keep an eye out for the terms “download”, “pre-packaged”, “pre-built” and “binaries” (the terms developers commonly use to refer to ready-to-use apps).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/github-powertoys-1.png"                      alt="The GitHub page for Microsoft PowerToys."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925484/19272" target="_top" id="1925484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925484/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Failing that, look for a link to the project or developers’ website in the README and head there, as they may be hosting the binaries for their app themselves.</p><p> Finally, you can check the “Releases” section of the GitHub page for pre-built binaries. This is located in the sidebar to the right: Click on the bolded <strong>Releases</strong> heading, and then download a binary for your platform from there if one is supplied.</p><p>Close </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135375/19272" target="_top" id="2135375">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135375" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135375/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Free-Stuff-Shouldn’t-Come-With-Strings-Attached"><a href="#Free-Stuff-Shouldn’t-Come-With-Strings-Attached" class="headerlink" title="Free Stuff Shouldn’t Come With Strings Attached"></a>Free Stuff Shouldn’t Come With Strings Attached</h2><p> The adage “if it’s too good to be true, it probably is” doesn’t apply to free software, because it is often just as good as it looks. You just need to be careful about which software you trust to install on your devices.</p><p> While most free and open source software is made by honest, dedicated developers who just want to make the world better with free stuff, there are those who take advantage of this to try and push malicious software on unsuspecting users. If you have any doubts about downloading something, it pays to stop, think, and maybe check with a tech-savvy friend or family member before you continue.</p><p> If you’re looking for great software, be sure to also check out our <a class="link"   href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/1716000639058-updated-in-2024-detailed-evaluation-razer-kiyo-webcam/" >super-charged alternative to native Windows apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and our list of <a class="link"   href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/1721266301246-get-yours-now-top-rated-iphone-screen-protector-remover/" >best free Windows apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get you started.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-craft-a-compelling-metaverse-presence-with-these-tools/"><u>[Updated] Craft a Compelling Metaverse Presence with These Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-top-10-4k-screens/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to #Top 10 4K Screens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-gaming-experience-samsung-ue590-freesync-screen/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Gaming Experience Samsung UE590 FreeSync Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-comprehensive-tips-for-monitoring-subscriber-engagement/"><u>2024 Approved Comprehensive Tips for Monitoring Subscriber Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-professional-tips-for-perfectly-recording-your-powerpoint-sessions/"><u>2024 Approved Professional Tips for Perfectly Recording Your PowerPoint Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streaming-wars-the-top-10-platforms-ranked-and-compared/"><u>2024 Approved Streaming Wars The Top 10 Platforms Ranked and Compared</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-insider-guide-to-efficient-windows-10-usage/"><u>2024 Approved The Insider Guide to Efficient Windows 10 Usage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-windows-10-storage-guide-how-to-save-and-organize-mov/"><u>2024 Approved Windows 10 Storage Guide How to Save and Organize .mov</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfect-portraits-changing-picture-sizes-on-ios/"><u>In 2024, Perfect Portraits Changing Picture Sizes on iOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-sims-4-documentation-cutting-edge-methods-to-preserve-gaming-experiences/"><u>In 2024, Sims 4 Documentation Cutting-Edge Methods to Preserve Gaming Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/innovative-gadget-reviews-by-technology-expert-toms-domain/"><u>Innovative Gadget Reviews by Technology Expert, Tom's Domain</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/los-mejores-y-libres-transcodificadores-de-video-en-4k-para-computadoras-convierte-sin-problemas-entre-resoluciones/"><u>Los Mejores Y Libres Transcodificadores De Video en 4K Para Computadoras - Convierte Sin Problemas Entre Resoluciones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/the-best-professional-template-pack-for-premiere-pro-for-2024/"><u>The Best Professional Template Pack for Premiere Pro for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/top-4-sim-location-trackers-to-easily-find-your-lost-samsung-galaxy-xcover-7-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 4 SIM Location Trackers To Easily Find Your Lost Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/twitch-live-reset-guide-for-2024/"><u>Twitch Live Reset Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/unlocking-full-potential-with-powerdirector-a-comprehensive-review-for-2024/"><u>Unlocking Full Potential with PowerDirector - A Comprehensive Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-cut-and-split-wmv-videos-for-free-top-software-picks/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Cut and Split WMV Videos for Free Top Software Picks</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unpacking-the-Advanced-Capabilities-of-Movavi-Video-Editor-2024"><a href="#Unpacking-the-Advanced-Capabilities-of-Movavi-Video-Editor-2024" class="headerlink" title="Unpacking the Advanced Capabilities of Movavi Video Editor 2024+"></a>Unpacking the Advanced Capabilities of Movavi Video Editor 2024+</h2><p>The objective of Movavi’s video editing software is to make it simple to create movies and clips, eschewing the sometimes-pointless complexity of the competition. Does that actually work in practice? It sounds fantastic, but After all, producing engaging movies frequently calls for sophisticated equipment and skills.</p><p>Additionally, you need a tool that renders the result rapidly and is responsive. Yes, to answer briefly. One of the greatest tools we’ve seen at cramming a lot of functionality into a friendly interface is Movavi Video Editor Plus.</p><p>With that out of the way, let’s start!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/movavi-video-editor-plus-2022.jpg"                      alt="movavi video editor plus 2022"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Introduction-to-the-interface"><a href="#Part-1-Introduction-to-the-interface" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Introduction to the interface"></a>Part 1. Introduction to the interface</h2><p>Movavi Video Editor Plus is refreshingly simple and clearly identifies each component. When you first start using the application, a series of tooltips that describe how to utilize it appear. You may choose between the modes for Importing, Filters, Transitions, Titles, Stickers, and other things using the buttons on the left rail. Important functions like Color Adjustments, Crop and Rotate, Pan and Zoom, Stabilization, Slow Motion, and Chroma-Keying are included in the final group. If I were developing the program, I’d prioritize them above Stickers (as entertaining as they are).</p><p>Along with importing, the Import mode has sections for the standard Media bin, which contains all project content, as well as for sounds, music, sample videos, backgrounds, and effect packages.</p><p>The program’s main section structure is similar to that of most video editing programs, with a source box in the upper left corner, timeline tracks spanning the whole bottom half of the window, and a preview player in the upper right. Only the video preview panel may be docked, but you can change the other panels’ relative sizes.</p><p>You can add as many tracks as you like above the timeline, which has buttons for Split, Rotate, Crop, Color Adjustments, Clip Properties, Markers, Record Video, and Record Audio.</p><p>With the mouse wheel and the Ctrl key, you may resize the timeline and pause and resume playing of the video. While Movavi does not support the typical pro J, K, and L for playback and I and O for in and out edits, it does support several keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>Because it functions between sessions, the undo option is excellent. This implies that I can close a project and yet undo earlier decisions when I open it again. Another wonderful feature is the addition of a star to the timeline clip whenever a video or audio effect is applied.

The majority of the sample audio and video that the application offers are downloaded after you click on them. You can look for any of the transitions or effects using a search box. The More Tools area is where the real fun begins (which changes to All Tools when you enter it).</p><p>The Overlays, Stabilization, Animation, Chroma-Key, and Audio tools are accessible from this page. The sole keyframe editing option in the program is on the Advanced tab of the Animation page, which is okay. It’s a benefit for the program’s goal of ease of use because keyframe editing, which enables you indicate precisely where on the timeline an effect should start and finish, is restricted to size, position, opacity, and rotation. PowerDirector or  Studio, which allow you to timing every effect and edit you apply with keyframes, are the best options for individuals who desire complete control over positions and effects.</p><p>Saturation, White Balance, Auto Contrast, and Magic Enhance are all included in the list of color modifications. On test clips, these performed admirably, with the Magic Enhance adding presence and life to the image.</p><p>Additionally, you can manually change the color parameters as seen below. You can adjust your scene’s atmosphere to seven other looks, including Drama, Thriller, Vintage, and Trip to Mars, thanks to a respectable range of available LUTs. The traditional day-for-night effect is noticeably absent (though it’s rarely fully convincing when it is).</p><p>You can use picture-in-picture effects with video clips that are overlapping on the timeline in different tracks by using the Overlay section. There are a few video collage themes included, fewer than some other tools, and you can resize and arrange the images however you choose. The compass that emerges when your inner image is horizontally or vertically centered is a positive.</p><p>You may see the results after setting the accuracy and shaking parameters in the stabilization tool. Its performance in a test clip impressed me. Even a strong tremble was eliminated, and compared to the original, the video had a more serene atmosphere overall.</p><p>Speed editing takes place in two locations. You can change the clip speed from 10% to 1,000% using the Speed slider on the Clip Properties screen. Simply slowing down the speed is what the Slow Motion option does. You can add a Freeze-Frame effect by right-clicking with the mouse on a clip in the timeline and selecting Insert Freeze Frame even if it isn’t in either of these panels. The Clip Properties window now provides the option to reverse playback.</p><p>Motion Tracking is available for text and stickers in addition to the Highlight and Conceal portion of All Tools. You start by selecting a mask, which can either be a black shape or a blurred shape. Following that, you can decide on the shape’s opacity, feathering, and outline appearance. The next step is tracking, which can be either swift, exact, or automated. In my tests, the latter wasn’t that slow, and it continued to track the tracked subject even after she passed behind a telephone pole, but not when she did so behind a vehicle. The most recent update, version 22.3, includes a new AI motion tracking option that can follow the subject even after she passes in front of a car (screenshot above) (see video below).</p><p>Although the Chroma-Key tool naturally starts with green as the key, you may utilize any background color in the photo by using a dropper. The tolerance, noise, edges, and opacity can all be changed. It functions, although not as well as some rivals. For instance, it gives you the option to key out many background colors.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-from-newcomer-to-pro-a-step-by-step-creator-hub-guidebook/"><u>[Updated] From Newcomer to Pro A Step-by-Step Creator Hub Guidebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-top-ten-entrepreneurial-youtube-outlets-and-tips/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top Ten Entrepreneurial YouTube Outlets & Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-captioning-text-techniques-for-images-in-oses/"><u>[Updated] The Art of Captioning Text Techniques for Images in OSes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-vlc-potentials-the-top-10-undiscovered-features/"><u>2024 Approved Unlocking VLC Potentials The Top 10 Undiscovered Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/guide-on-how-to-change-your-apple-id-email-address-on-iphone-xs-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Guide on How To Change Your Apple ID Email Address On iPhone XS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-comprehensive-insight-into-benqs-bl2711u-pioneering-the-4k-standard/"><u>In 2024, A Comprehensive Insight Into BenQ’s BL2711U - Pioneering the 4K Standard</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-essential-tutorial-for-stunning-hdr-portraits/"><u>In 2024, The Essential Tutorial for Stunning HDR Portraits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-unleash-zooms-full-potential-with-essential-3-methods/"><u>In 2024, Unleash Zoom's Full Potential with Essential 3 Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-final-cut-pro-x-captioning-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>New In 2024, Final Cut Pro X Captioning A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/pivotal-ideas-in-tech-driven-story-weaving-for-2024/"><u>Pivotal Ideas in Tech-Driven Story Weaving for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/toms-tech-review-expert-insights-on-the-latest-computer-components/"><u>Tom's Tech Review: Expert Insights on the Latest Computer Components</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/whats-trending-on-tiktok-and-twittersphere/"><u>What's Trending on TikTok and Twittersphere</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly.

In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology. If you want to know more details about Metaverse, this article will be helpful: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Everything you wanted to know about the metaverse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>To get a fairer idea, one can head straight to a number of social media platforms and game universes that are offering today entry into such hyper-real virtual spaces. Some of these platforms are:</p><h3 id="1-Meta"><a href="#1-Meta" class="headerlink" title="1. Meta"></a>1. Meta</h3><p>Apart from the acquisition of Oculus, a company that manufactures Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, in 2014, the tech mammoth Facebook has made public its immense interest in virtual reality by rebranding itself as Meta this year. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, voiced his support for the Metaverse when, while declaring the rebranding, he said, “The next platform and medium will be a much more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse.” Meta has delivered on this by unveiling the Horizon Workrooms beta, a virtual meeting area designed for co-workers to hold their meetings using a metaverse device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-meta.jpg"                      alt="metaverse device meta"                ></p><h3 id="2-Microsoft"><a href="#2-Microsoft" class="headerlink" title="2. Microsoft"></a>2. Microsoft</h3><p>It is another tech giant that has advanced considerably in this direction when it revealed its very own hologram technology back in 2019. Microsoft holograms can change someone into a digital speaker of an alien language. The Microsoft Mesh platform has since then been busy developing mixed and extended reality applications. Microsoft has also made known its intention of developing Microsoft Teams along these lines in 2022. Collaboration with the U.S. army is also underway aimed at designing an augmented reality Hololens 2 hardware that will help soldiers train better. Microsoft’s Xbox Live must be accounted for here as well as it establishes connections between millions of video gamers from around the globe. The company would also start working on the development of 3D hyper-real spaces for the world of retail and general workplaces.</p><h3 id="3-Epic-Games"><a href="#3-Epic-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Epic Games"></a>3. Epic Games</h3><p>Epic Games is a video game company that has made headlines by virtue of its extraordinary contributions in this regard. “It’s no secret that Epic is invested in building the metaverse”, said Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games. Epic Games has made it further immersive by holding music concerts by artists like Arianna Grande, Travis Scott, unveiling movie trailers and music debuts in the metaverse. A splendid remaking of Martin Luther King Jr’s famed “I Have a Dream” speech earned it further credentials. Epic Games is reportedly emphasizing its MetaHuman Creator, a technology that helps users customize better their digital avatars.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know"><a href="#Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know"></a>Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</h2><p>It is entering the metaverse that necessitates that one first has one’s props ready. Below are discussed metaverse devices that are crucial for such transportation.</p><h3 id="1-Computer-PC"><a href="#1-Computer-PC" class="headerlink" title="1. Computer (PC)"></a>1. Computer (PC)</h3><p>Laying your hands on a perfectly functioning computer device is one of the first necessities. Intel grabbed worldwide attention a few days ago when it said that for metaverse to work properly, one will need devices with 1000x more computing power than what the technology offers today. But since metaverse is still in its embryo, the configuration we have already functioned just fine.</p><h3 id="2-Smartphone"><a href="#2-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="2. Smartphone"></a>2. Smartphone</h3><p>Smartphones are the next important metaverse device with chipmakers like Qualcomm, Samsung already sharing their dedication to the mobile metaverse segment. Smartphones with the hardware they already come with are useful though for enjoying some of the games and platforms that use augmented reality.</p><h3 id="3-5G-Mobile-Networks"><a href="#3-5G-Mobile-Networks" class="headerlink" title="3.5G Mobile Networks"></a>3.5G Mobile Networks</h3><p>For metaverse to really get under one’s skin, one needs a powerful and lightning-fast network that 5G technology promises. Extensive penetration of 5G mobile networks is therefore extremely important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-5g-network.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device 5G Network"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136623/26400" target="_top" id="2136623">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136623" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136623/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Source: firstpoint-mg.com</p><h3 id="4-AR-Glasses"><a href="#4-AR-Glasses" class="headerlink" title="4.

These are smart wearables and help in embodied experiences.</p><h3 id="5-VR-Headset"><a href="#5-VR-Headset" class="headerlink" title="5. VR Headset"></a>5. VR Headset</h3><p>Virtual Reality (VR) headsets make use of technologies such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers, etc along with a stereoscopic head-mounted display that provides separate images for each eye. Among metaverse devices, these are steadily gaining popularity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-glasses-hololens.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse VR Headset"                ></p><p>Source: theverge.com</p><h3 id="6-VR-Gloves"><a href="#6-VR-Gloves" class="headerlink" title="6.

Sounds insane but companies like HaptX have already offered their line-ups of such hyper-real interfaces.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-vr-gloves.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device VR Gloves"                ></p><p>Source: wired.com</p><h3 id="7-Wrist-Based-Bands"><a href="#7-Wrist-Based-Bands" class="headerlink" title="7.

As long as the ethical underpinnings of such a development get predominant over the technology part, we must welcome such efforts. As some reports on the prevailing sexist atmospheres in some metaverse spaces have underlined, the realm needs regulations. The impact on the environment, data privacy are some other issues that we must come to terms with. Beyond these, the possibilities that metaverse technology has already pointed at herald a future that is every bit worth experiencing.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The concept of metaverse needs not be demonized at this early stage. In fact, the very fact that the idea is still inchoate makes us agents of deciding whether we want to create a bubble universe that keeps out the digital proletariat or a universe that can get past the constraints of time and space to give a new lease of human creativity. But whatever the path that the technology takes, it is beyond dispute that the metaverse is here to stay. And this makes it mandatory that one gets acquainted with the gears that are needed to undertake this journey. With a flurry of brands offering good products, the only thing one needs to get right is the basics of such devices.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Buzzwords are nothing new.

What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly. So let us begin at the beginning by understanding what it is that we talk about when we are talking about Metaverse nowadays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device"                ></p><p>Source: thenextweb.com</p><h4 id="In-this-article-2"><a href="#In-this-article-2" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse Technology?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Eye on the Future: Where Will Metaverse Go?</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118314/7443" target="_top" id="2118314">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118314" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118314/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?"></a>Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?</h2><p>The word Metaverse might be a hot topic today but it has been around for quite a significant amount of time now. In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology.

And this makes it mandatory that one gets acquainted with the gears that are needed to undertake this journey. With a flurry of brands offering good products, the only thing one needs to get right is the basics of such devices.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Buzzwords are nothing new. What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly. So let us begin at the beginning by understanding what it is that we talk about when we are talking about Metaverse nowadays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device"                ></p><p>Source: thenextweb.com</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse Technology?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Eye on the Future: Where Will Metaverse Go?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?"></a>Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?</h2><p>The word Metaverse might be a hot topic today but it has been around for quite a significant amount of time now. In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology.

Some of these platforms are:</p><h3 id="1-Meta-3"><a href="#1-Meta-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Meta"></a>1. Meta</h3><p>Apart from the acquisition of Oculus, a company that manufactures Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, in 2014, the tech mammoth Facebook has made public its immense interest in virtual reality by rebranding itself as Meta this year. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, voiced his support for the Metaverse when, while declaring the rebranding, he said, “The next platform and medium will be a much more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse.” Meta has delivered on this by unveiling the Horizon Workrooms beta, a virtual meeting area designed for co-workers to hold their meetings using a metaverse device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-meta.jpg"                      alt="metaverse device meta"                ></p><h3 id="2-Microsoft-3"><a href="#2-Microsoft-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Microsoft"></a>2. Microsoft</h3><p>It is another tech giant that has advanced considerably in this direction when it revealed its very own hologram technology back in 2019. Microsoft holograms can change someone into a digital speaker of an alien language. The Microsoft Mesh platform has since then been busy developing mixed and extended reality applications. Microsoft has also made known its intention of developing Microsoft Teams along these lines in 2022. Collaboration with the U.S. army is also underway aimed at designing an augmented reality Hololens 2 hardware that will help soldiers train better. Microsoft’s Xbox Live must be accounted for here as well as it establishes connections between millions of video gamers from around the globe. The company would also start working on the development of 3D hyper-real spaces for the world of retail and general workplaces.</p><h3 id="3-Epic-Games-3"><a href="#3-Epic-Games-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Epic Games"></a>3. Epic Games</h3><p>Epic Games is a video game company that has made headlines by virtue of its extraordinary contributions in this regard. “It’s no secret that Epic is invested in building the metaverse”, said Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games. Epic Games has made it further immersive by holding music concerts by artists like Arianna Grande, Travis Scott, unveiling movie trailers and music debuts in the metaverse. A splendid remaking of Martin Luther King Jr’s famed “I Have a Dream” speech earned it further credentials. Epic Games is reportedly emphasizing its MetaHuman Creator, a technology that helps users customize better their digital avatars.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know-3"><a href="#Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know"></a>Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</h2><p>It is entering the metaverse that necessitates that one first has one’s props ready. Below are discussed metaverse devices that are crucial for such transportation.</p><h3 id="1-Computer-PC-3"><a href="#1-Computer-PC-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Computer (PC)"></a>1. Computer (PC)</h3><p>Laying your hands on a perfectly functioning computer device is one of the first necessities. Intel grabbed worldwide attention a few days ago when it said that for metaverse to work properly, one will need devices with 1000x more computing power than what the technology offers today. But since metaverse is still in its embryo, the configuration we have already functioned just fine.</p><h3 id="2-Smartphone-3"><a href="#2-Smartphone-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Smartphone"></a>2. Smartphone</h3><p>Smartphones are the next important metaverse device with chipmakers like Qualcomm, Samsung already sharing their dedication to the mobile metaverse segment. Smartphones with the hardware they already come with are useful though for enjoying some of the games and platforms that use augmented reality.</p><h3 id="3-5G-Mobile-Networks-3"><a href="#3-5G-Mobile-Networks-3" class="headerlink" title="3.5G Mobile Networks"></a>3.5G Mobile Networks</h3><p>For metaverse to really get under one’s skin, one needs a powerful and lightning-fast network that 5G technology promises. Extensive penetration of 5G mobile networks is therefore extremely important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-5g-network.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device 5G Network"                ></p><p>Source: firstpoint-mg.com</p><h3 id="4-AR-Glasses-3"><a href="#4-AR-Glasses-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

As long as the ethical underpinnings of such a development get predominant over the technology part, we must welcome such efforts. As some reports on the prevailing sexist atmospheres in some metaverse spaces have underlined, the realm needs regulations. The impact on the environment, data privacy are some other issues that we must come to terms with. Beyond these, the possibilities that metaverse technology has already pointed at herald a future that is every bit worth experiencing.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The concept of metaverse needs not be demonized at this early stage. In fact, the very fact that the idea is still inchoate makes us agents of deciding whether we want to create a bubble universe that keeps out the digital proletariat or a universe that can get past the constraints of time and space to give a new lease of human creativity. But whatever the path that the technology takes, it is beyond dispute that the metaverse is here to stay.

This should prevent infostealer malware from accessing critical user data, specifically browser cookies and saved passwords.</p><p> Private data in Chrome is already encrypted. That said, security methods vary by operating system. Chrome uses Apple’s Keychain services on macOS, for example, and it taps into system-provided wallets on Linux. These cybersecurity systems successfully protect most macOS and Linux users from <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004582/https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threats/info-stealers" >infostealer malware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but Windows’ system, called the <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%5FProtection%5FAPI" >Data Protection API <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (DPAPI), is comparatively vulnerable. It doesn’t prevent malicious applications from executing code at the user level, and as a result, any infostealer malware that manages to dodge Windows Defender may interact with encrypted app data.</p><p> Infostealer malware tends to be quite sophisticated. The hackers that distribute such malware are clever, too. We recently reported on an infostealer malware that was <a class="link"   href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-iphone-12-pro-stuck-at-attempting-data-recovery-loop-stellar-by-stellar-data-recovery-ios-iphone-data-recovery/" >slipped into Google Search ads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Humans are easy to fool and operating systems are flawed, so instead of waiting for Microsoft to improve DPAPI, Google is adding App-Bound Encryption on top of the existing security system.</p><blockquote><p>“In Chrome 127 we are introducing a new protection on Windows that improves on the DPAPI by providing Application-Bound (App-Bound) Encryption primitives. Rather than allowing any app running as the logged in user to access this data, Chrome can now encrypt data tied to app identity, similar to how the Keychain operates on macOS.”</p></blockquote><p> Data protected by App-Bound Encryption can only be accessed by an app with the correct decryption key. So, cookies and passwords that are saved by Chrome 127 on Windows can only be accessed by the Chrome browser. This data cannot be accessed by malware or any other software (be it malicious or benign).</p><p> Yes, there are circumstances in which App-Bound Encryption may be bypassed. Malware could circumvent this encryption method by elevating itself to system privileges or injecting code into Chrome, for example. But, as Google explains, these actions are almost guaranteed to trigger a response from Windows Defender. Chrome’s App-Bound Encryption method, while not bulletproof, is a massive improvement over standard DPAPI behavior. It’s a protection that should be offered by more Windows apps, especially as infostealer malware grows more common.</p><p> These security improvements are available in <a class="link"   href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/" >Chrome 127 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on Windows.
