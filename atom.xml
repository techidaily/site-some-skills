Every minute, YouTube receives more than 100 hours of video. Whether you’re disseminating information to students or marketing activities, it’s among the most significant ways to reach a large audience. Some of the benefits of YouTube are listed below.</p><p><strong>Your SEO may use some improvement</strong></p><p>One of the most widely used content types is video, frequently shared on social media.

Video is a beautiful medium for expressing the feeling and physical characteristics of your marketing because people respond positively to visual cues.</p><p><strong>Don’t Tell, Show</strong></p><p>Concepts that are difficult to express in word form can be effectively demonstrated through video: use screen capture recordings, live demonstrations, or even whiteboard drawings to present to your pupils.</p><p><strong>Reach a Greater Audience with Your Message</strong></p><p>YouTube is the world’s most widely used video site, and its videos are very shareable. Think about how frequently videos appear on your Twitter feed or Facebook Timeline. How often do you get emails with videos?

Additionally, a simple thumbs-up or heart can go a long way to demonstrate that you are paying attention even if you aren’t feeling very friendly (we all have bad days, it’s OK!).</p><h2 id="Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is"><a href="#Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is" class="headerlink" title="Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?"></a>Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?</h2><p>A highlighted comment on YouTube aims to draw the content creator’s attention with an automated feature.</p><p>When you click over to the comments area after receiving a notification about a new comment or a reply to one of your comments, that particular comment will be highlighted for quick access.</p><p>To put it another way, YouTube flags notable comments for you to ensure that new messages or significant replies aren’t lost in the noise. Once you have read or replied to the comment, the highlight will go.</p><p>Additionally, video creators can manually highlight commenters to mark them for later responses. To do this, click on the comment’s timestamp (found next to the commenter’s username).

How to live stream with Online OneStream"></a>Part 3. How to live stream with Online OneStream</h2><p>Live streaming with OneStream is pretty straightforward. I will walk you through a series of steps you can follow to live stream using OneStream successfully.</p><p>Step1 First, head to <a class="link"   href="https://app.onestream.live/signup" >OneStream live website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create an account. Just input a username, password, and email address. After that, you need to choose a plan. OneStream offers 4 plans, as I have mentioned above. Just go through the plan features and choose the one that best suits you.</p><p>Step2 After you have successfully picked a plan, on the dashboard, you will see 40 top social platforms, and you will be requested to add your social accounts. If you can’t see the social platform you want to live stream to, you can use custom RTMP to stream it. Except for Instagram, you can connect all of your social accounts directly.</p><p>To connect your Instagram account, you must utilize a third-party software called Instafeed. Instead, it will construct your Instagram account’s Sync URL. Once the URL is generated, please copy and paste it into the OneStream Sync URL section. It will successfully connect your Instagram account to OneStream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-1.jpg"                      alt="connect onstream to your social accounts"                ></p><p>Step3 To schedule your live stream on the dashboard, click the “three-line” button.

The finer 4K details and added steadyshot image stabilization feature makes it really useful for athletes and other adventure sports lovers. The one thing where it still needs to improve is the chunky controls and atrocious menus. As GoPro hero is available with the same price tag so these little missing details can force buyers to follow the GoPro series again. There is no doubt to say that GoPro Hero4 Black offers wide range of accessories but after viewing all the updated features of Sony FDR-X1000 we can say that Sony is working in right direction. If you are in favour of flexibility and want to access the GPS tagging feature for your shoots then it is really good to go ahead with FDR-X1000.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-terracore-pros-fusion-of-touch-and-high-definition/"><u>[New] TerraCore Pros  Fusion of Touch & High Definition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-transforming-ordinary-interviews-into-impactful-experiences/"><u>[New] Transforming Ordinary Interviews Into Impactful Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-xbox-one-and-zoom-harmony/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Xbox One and Zoom Harmony</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-science-of-perfectly-timed-episodes/"><u>[Updated] The Science of Perfectly Timed Episodes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-uncovering-the-mysteries-of-photo-editing-in-canva/"><u>In 2024, Uncovering the Mysteries of Photo Editing in Canva</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-streaming-software-showdown-the-verdict-on-wirecast-vs-obs/"><u>[Updated] Streaming Software Showdown  The Verdict on Wirecast Vs.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Thorough-Examination-Easy-HDR-Techniques-Guide"><a href="#Thorough-Examination-Easy-HDR-Techniques-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Thorough Examination: Easy HDR Techniques Guide"></a>Thorough Examination: Easy HDR Techniques Guide</h2><p>Any professional photographer knows that “photography” is a broad niche. For example, HDR photography involves taking images in dark and bright areas. But because these images might not show much to the naked eyes, you’ll need an HDR program like <strong>EasyHDR</strong>. This software can recreate and design incredible HDR photos on Mac and Windows computers. So, this review post advises you whether <strong>Easy HDR</strong> is worth the money or not. We’ll also advise on the best way to edit and create HDR videos on PC.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR"></a>Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>EasyHDR is an HDR photography software for highlighting image details in HDR photos. It supports raw images and batch processing.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pricing</td><td>$33 for a lifetime license</td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10&#x2F;11 and macOS 10.12 or newer</td></tr><tr><td>Layout</td><td>4.5&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>Easy to use</td><td>4.8&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>HDQ quality</td><td>4.2&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>Post-processing</td><td>3.5&#x2F;5</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Before we dive deeper into this <strong>Easy HDRi</strong> review, let’s first discuss how this HDR software rates in some critical aspects:</p><ol><li><strong>Effectiveness – 4.8&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>The HDRi process on this software is very effective, although you shouldn’t have high expectations. It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.</p><ol><li><strong>Price – 4.7&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there’s a free demo version, it’s pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.</p><ol><li><strong>Supported OS – 5&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!</p><ol><li><strong>Ease of use – 4.8</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.</p><ol><li><strong>Best for – Beginner HDRi editors</strong></li></ol><p>This program’s simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills.

So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device’s microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.</p><p>The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its own voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.</p><p>Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.</p><p>Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:</p><ol><li>Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select <strong>System Preferences</strong> from the resulting menu.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Keyboard</strong> option from the system preferences screen.</li><li>Once there, click on the <strong>Dictation</strong> option located at the top of the menu.</li><li>Select <strong>On</strong> to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the <strong>Use Enhanced Dictation</strong> box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.</li><li>Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.</li></ol><p>Please note that you need to speak your punctuations loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Top-5-Dragon-for-Mac"><a href="#Part-5-Top-5-Dragon-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Top 5 Dragon for Mac"></a>Part 5: Top 5 Dragon for Mac</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/dragon-for-mac-5.jpg"                      alt="top 5 dragon for mac"                ></p><p>Dragon Dictate is arguably the best dictation software currently on the market. According to most users, its accuracy and feature sets are next to none. For example, the Smart Format Rules learns how you represent dates, numbers, and abbreviations, resulting in less editing work for you. The Dragon Dictate app is free to download from the Apple Store.</p><p>Dragon for Mac users report a dictation accuracy of nearly 99%, which is excellent in the speech to text software category. All of Nuance’s Dragon products use deep learning technology to capture your accent and cadence. As such, the app gets better at transcribing your text as you continue using it. In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files. For example, you can import audio from your iPhone to your Dragon Dictate workspace and transcribe it hassle-free.</p><p>Unfortunately, you cannot get a stand-alone dragon app for Mac. This is because Nuance discontinued its development in 2018. In addition, Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in 2021 proves that the decision is permanent. However, you can still use the Windows version of Dragon through Parallels, which allows you to run macOS and Windows simultaneously. In addition, this method also works for M1 Macs.</p><h2 id="Part-6-FAQs"><a href="#Part-6-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: FAQs"></a>Part 6: FAQs</h2><h3 id="Is-there-a-difference-between-voice-recognition-and-speech-to-text"><a href="#Is-there-a-difference-between-voice-recognition-and-speech-to-text" class="headerlink" title="Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech to text?"></a>Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech to text?</h3><p>Voice recognition software allows your device to capture your accent and tone and then stores that data for different functions, such as user logins and speech to text functionality.

So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device’s microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.</p><p>The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its own voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.</p><p>Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.</p><p>Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:</p><ol><li>Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select <strong>System Preferences</strong> from the resulting menu.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Keyboard</strong> option from the system preferences screen.</li><li>Once there, click on the <strong>Dictation</strong> option located at the top of the menu.</li><li>Select <strong>On</strong> to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the <strong>Use Enhanced Dictation</strong> box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.</li><li>Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.</li></ol><p>Please note that you need to speak your punctuations loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Top-5-Dragon-for-Mac-1"><a href="#Part-5-Top-5-Dragon-for-Mac-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Top 5 Dragon for Mac"></a>Part 5: Top 5 Dragon for Mac</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/dragon-for-mac-5.jpg"                      alt="top 5 dragon for mac"                ></p><p>Dragon Dictate is arguably the best dictation software currently on the market. According to most users, its accuracy and feature sets are next to none. For example, the Smart Format Rules learns how you represent dates, numbers, and abbreviations, resulting in less editing work for you. The Dragon Dictate app is free to download from the Apple Store.</p><p>Dragon for Mac users report a dictation accuracy of nearly 99%, which is excellent in the speech to text software category. All of Nuance’s Dragon products use deep learning technology to capture your accent and cadence. As such, the app gets better at transcribing your text as you continue using it. In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files. For example, you can import audio from your iPhone to your Dragon Dictate workspace and transcribe it hassle-free.</p><p>Unfortunately, you cannot get a stand-alone dragon app for Mac. This is because Nuance discontinued its development in 2018. In addition, Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in 2021 proves that the decision is permanent. However, you can still use the Windows version of Dragon through Parallels, which allows you to run macOS and Windows simultaneously. In addition, this method also works for M1 Macs.</p><h2 id="Part-6-FAQs-1"><a href="#Part-6-FAQs-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: FAQs"></a>Part 6: FAQs</h2><h3 id="Is-there-a-difference-between-voice-recognition-and-speech-to-text-1"><a href="#Is-there-a-difference-between-voice-recognition-and-speech-to-text-1" class="headerlink" title="Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech to text?"></a>Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech to text?</h3><p>Voice recognition software allows your device to capture your accent and tone and then stores that data for different functions, such as user logins and speech to text functionality.

What are the types of Vector Graphic Files?</h2><p>You can use the websites mentioned in the list here to search for various vector images and get successful results. However, the need for vector images sometimes depends on their primary use to people, like printing or web design. There are specific formats for vector stock images that you should consider carefully to download the suitable graphical file for your project.</p><ul><li><strong>.ai (Adobe Illustrator)-</strong> The AI file type mainly works for Adobe Illustrator users and is an option to replace old-school EPS files. Adobe apps can access and showcase these files in the best quality compared to other programs.</li><li><strong>.eps (Encapsulated PostScript)-</strong> The EPS or Encapsulated PostScript files are older vector image types for more extensive format-based printing. The text is easier to resize and enlarge in this lossless format with zero quality defects. It is commonly used in professional printing projects, like billboards and posters in the physical format and icons and logos in digital format. This is not compatible with other raster image formats.</li><li><strong>PDF (Portable Document Format)-</strong> The PDF file type relates to portable digital documents that are the standard option for forms, documents, and graphics. Note that this file extension type works with both raster and vector images- i.e., you can apply both images into a PDF file. In terms of usage, this format is best for getting high-quality uniform documental file prints.</li><li><strong>.svg (Scalable Vector Graphics)-</strong> SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is the conventional vector file format that web designers focus on. It has universal open standard support, works on different browsers, and appears smooth and crisp during displays on differently-sized screens. The SVG files are mainly used for web-based file transfers.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images" class="headerlink" title="Part III.

What are the types of Vector Graphic Files?</h2><p>You can use the websites mentioned in the list here to search for various vector images and get successful results. However, the need for vector images sometimes depends on their primary use to people, like printing or web design. There are specific formats for vector stock images that you should consider carefully to download the suitable graphical file for your project.</p><ul><li><strong>.ai (Adobe Illustrator)-</strong> The AI file type mainly works for Adobe Illustrator users and is an option to replace old-school EPS files. Adobe apps can access and showcase these files in the best quality compared to other programs.</li><li><strong>.eps (Encapsulated PostScript)-</strong> The EPS or Encapsulated PostScript files are older vector image types for more extensive format-based printing. The text is easier to resize and enlarge in this lossless format with zero quality defects. It is commonly used in professional printing projects, like billboards and posters in the physical format and icons and logos in digital format. This is not compatible with other raster image formats.</li><li><strong>PDF (Portable Document Format)-</strong> The PDF file type relates to portable digital documents that are the standard option for forms, documents, and graphics. Note that this file extension type works with both raster and vector images- i.e., you can apply both images into a PDF file. In terms of usage, this format is best for getting high-quality uniform documental file prints.</li><li><strong>.svg (Scalable Vector Graphics)-</strong> SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is the conventional vector file format that web designers focus on. It has universal open standard support, works on different browsers, and appears smooth and crisp during displays on differently-sized screens. The SVG files are mainly used for web-based file transfers.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images-1"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images-1" class="headerlink" title="Part III.
